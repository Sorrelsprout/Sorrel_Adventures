<h2>Tuesday - March 11, 2025</h2>

<h3>Sunnyvale, CA</h3>
<p>Finished last-minute drafts for OMS and sent them off. My mom and I got into our first shouting match in a while, I had wondered how long it'd take for that to happen... Did some last-minute packing, and went to the bank to take care of an expiring CD. Work wrapped up ok, and then my mom and I took an airport to the SJ Minetta Airport. We got some seriously mediocre bagels at a pla e I don't even want to bother to name, the pickled peppers made me queasy and gave me a stomachache. I got to call my best friend in SoCal a bit before boarding. As we were taking off, I saw the Fremont mountains. I thought, if there was an aircraft malfunction and somehow we got stuck in SJ, that would really suck. Felt my jaw clench and thought of that quote from <a href="http://www.nightinthewoods.com" target="_blank">Night in the Woods</a>, "I'd rather die anywhere else." Coming back to the bay has been mentally taxing enough, but thinking about getting an injury where I'd be trapped there and potentially have to see my dad... that would suck so fucking much. As the bay slowly went away from view so high up (snagged a window seat), I felt my body physically relax more, and started journaling. The flight to LA was decent and short.</p>

<h3>LAX</h3>
<p>Got Panda Express because that was the fastest place with vegan options and I felt my hands shaking from starvation. My mom gets that too but she didn't have that reaction. We sat and ate, and was surprised at how little options there were for such a massive and populated airport for even vegetarians. After that we walked to the gate, and boarding took an hour because it was SO crowded. Luckily during that time I could catch up on messages and charge my phone. I wondered what it'd be like losing access to Google/Reddit/Signal/most everything else I used regularly... supposed that taking photos and texting would be the way to go, like how it was like years ago. Got lucky to have another window seat!</p>

<h2>Wednesday - March 12, 2025</h2>

<h3>Air China to Shenzhen</h3>
<p>We had to exit the gates and go to baggage claim, then re-enter. It was a bit of a struggle. On the flight, had to nap because I was SO tired. Wanted to fall asleep right after eating the Panda Express, I slept from about 11PM to 5:30AM Pacific time, then woke up and opened a written note my friend gave me before I left home. It was fun responding to it, and then I had to use the restroom which was surprisingly cleaner than expected.</p>
<p>The in-flight meal I got ahead of everyone else (I guess they brought out the vegan/dietary restrictive options first. Got curry rice with chickpeas and spinach. There was a thing of bread, a little side salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, and arugula. There was also a little bowl of chopped fruit with half a strawberry, cantaloupe, and pineapple. It was surprisingly good, and the best plane food I've ever had. Very shocked, since the first time I had Chinese plane food it tasted so disturbingly bad. Everything I got looked much better than my mom's (she got some kind of weird mystery meat thing) in her curry. She even admitted that my food looked better, and I offered her some but she didn't take any.</p>
<p>The second in-flight meal we received about 3h 40min prior to landing (13-14hr flight in total). There was fried rice, a muffin, and fruit (grapes and melon). I saved the muffin for later but everything was decently tasty again. I still missed home, but I missed it a bit less since we got so far away from CA.</p>
<p>On the flight, I didn't do much aside from sleep. We passed above bits of Mongolia. I played this in-flight entertainment game called Doudizhu (斗地主，translates to“fight the landlord”). At one point, bothered my mom out of mild boredom and used one of my braids to stroke her arm but it made her remember the time when she went back to China to visit my grandma after she'd passed away and she had a nightmare that night staying where my grandma used to live about an entity with long hair (that she thought was my grandma at first, even though my grandma didn't have long hair IRL) that was really vivid and disturbing. The figure had pounced on her and she started praying to Guanyin, to Jesus, to Whatevergod and the figure started slowly getting smaller and smaller until it shrunk to a small, dark, fetus-like thing and she woke up. She said it was super vivd and could still feel like the figure's hair could stroke her. She had been sleeping on the couch of where my grandma and my grandma's sister-in-law had lived, and had to actually move to sleep in the same bed as the sis in law because she was so horrified and scared. So I felt really guilty about that and never did it again.</p>
<p>Can't imagine how it must have felt and wish I had the capacity to carry her mental health too, even with all of our not seeing eye-to-eye-ness. I wished I had the capacity to be a better daughter... thugh I guess by me going on this trip I could do some of that. I can see my mom as a human being with flaws, as someone who used to be a child, who has lived a very different life than I have in a way that I haven't been able to acknowledge when I was younger. I want her to not feel bad even if I don;'t agree on many things with her. These incongruencies while still trying to keep my own mental health stable feels so volatile and it's uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>Thursday - March 13, 2025</h2>
<h3>Shenzhen Airport to Chengdu</h3>
<p>We had a 3h layover and had to enter the border control area with passport and fingerprint verification, and also fill out a form as to why we're traveling and when we'll return. My hands were so dry that my fingerprints didn't register, and a guard had to spray my hand with water to make the scan work. After that we went to pick up our baggage and had to go through a security checkpoint again. After re-entering we werre in a massive atrium and there were lots of bougie duty-free shops for perfumes and purses and such and folks aggressively trying to get places. Quite a few pushed past my mom who was trying to patiently wait to talk to the info desk lady... maybe this is a slice of culture shock?</p>
<p>After that we went to our gate but along the way we tried to find food/coffee. There was a place for jianbing and passionfruit tea called the <a href="https://www.szairport.com/szairporten/tscy/202310/43844ed108724fc28fab97a442fe777f.shtml" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">The Pancake and Tea</a> and this lady at the shop was using this cool T-shaped tool to make super delicious-looking jianbing, with lettuce, seasoning, and crispy crackers inside. It made me really miss and crave <a href="https://www.bingmipdx.com" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">Bing Mi</a> in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hbCYTRiK94mc1weq7" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">NW Portland</a>. If only the one we saw was vegan... the stand didn't even have any veggie options! We ended up getting two passionfruit green tea drinks. They were pretty tasty ajd not too sweet, and the seeds had a nice crunch to them. But when my mom tried to pay, the shopkeep pressed the button for American dollars instead of Chinese Yen and luckily my mom caught it. My mom had to verify if the vendor was trying to charge CNY or USD in case they were trying to scam us, especially since the vendor seemed a little shady (averted eye contact, repeatedly putting off an air of dismissiveness when my mom asked to see the charge screen of the tapping-pay system) with their mannerisms. She was pretty pissed and asked the shopkeep to redo it, and confirmed to pay in CNY instead. 32CNY is roughly $5 in American currency, and that was for 2 drinks, so $32 would have been about 15+ drinks, crazytown! After that, we sat aroung the gate waiting to board, and I tried to download Alipay so I could pay for things too, but the signal was awful. While we were waiting for the plane to Chengdu too, I had to use the bathroom. It was... unfortunately the squat toilets. I <em>despise</em> the squat toilets SO much.</p>

<h3>Flight to Chgengdu</h3>
<p>On the flight I don't know why but I still felt so exhausted. Napped more and woke up when our air hostess came by and asked what food we wanted. Another meal! But this time it was "breakfast" and they didn't have anything fully vegan. They had a vegetarian option but I couldn't have the bread (contained egg) or the drinkable yogurt, so I swapped those with my mom for her fruit (cantaloupe slices). There was also tea. As we were waiting for food, these overhead videos started playing and there was this advertisement on deerskins, which was pretty sickening. My mom said it was the culture of the folks in the video to hunt, and while I'm sure it's a very special and cultural practice, and the video was cinematic, it was disturbing to think of those poor deer. It was also unsettling to hear my mom's cognitive dissonance, knowing that an animal was harmed yet not acknowledging the pain/disturbing treatment of the corpse's skin. The flight was at least in daytime and I could see the clouds. I've gotten the window seat for 4 flights in a row, pretty lucky!</p>

<h3>Chengdu</h3>
<p>My uncle picked us up from the airport. The Chengdu airport was apparently constructed during the pandemic according to my mom, and my uncle drove us to his condo. Along the way I texted folks back (and got a little carsick) and looked out the window. There were There were so many massively tall buildings and a surprisingly cool amount of nature around, lots of dense yellow flowers called you cai (油菜，translates to "oil vegetable") and I even saw some tulip clusters! There were also SO many motorbikes and scooters.</p>
<p>My uncle briefly asked what I could/couldn't eat and asked if I could have food made with animal fats, and I heard my mom tell him in a hushed tone tell him not to bring it up. But I HEARD it. I had to remain vigilant and not consume any animal products... I was worried because we were going to dinner after that with more family. My uncle was a real road rager too, and he uses some REAL colorful swears. It's funny and terrifying at the same time, though he really is an excellent driver maneuvering around all the crowds of drivers. Driving in China is D&nbsp;I&nbsp;F&nbsp;F&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;E&nbsp;N&nbsp;T.</p>

<h3>Uncle's Condo</h3>
<p>When we got to his condo we also met up with my aunt. It was a little awkward and honestly I only semi-recognized my extended family. My aunt noted how much I look like my mom and I was just thankful she didn't mention my dad. Does my aunt even know? I also worry deep down that I'll carry the hardness and undesirable qualities that my mom has, and I don't want to be like either of my parents.</p>
<p>We went up to my uncle's place which was on the 7th floor of one of the numerous tall structures. His view is amazing! So much nature below, and he also keeps snake plants.We opened up the luggages and my mom distributed presents and such, for my aunt, uncle, their families, and other folks too. There was some hiding of presents going on because my mom didn't want my aunt to know how she got a specific thing for my uncle's wife, and also vice versa. So much family politics. I don't want my brother to have to deal with any of that shit, secrets suck but I guess it's necessary at times?</p>
<p>Anyways, I mainly just looked at my uncle's fish tank. It looked really sad, the fish had nowhere to hide and there was no greenery or anything and the tank was quite small for SO many fish. I ate a few bananas and passion fruits that my uncle gave me. The passion fruits were cool and tasty, instead of a brown exterior it was yellow, and I mistook them for wonky-looking lemons at first. After helping re-pack, we departed and my uncle drove us to our hotel.</p>

<h3>The Longemont Hotel</h3>
<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.longemonthotels-chengdu.com/en" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">Longemont Hotel</a> on the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/MddtjSkcHJaQHn167" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">39th floor</a>! It was sooo high up and it looks pretty sleek, though the wallpaper was peeling, someone was smoking somewhere (so we had to close the open window) and we couldn't find any temperature controls in the room at first so it was very toasty (but we found it eventually). They had american-style toilets!! I got so worried when I saw the squat-style toilets at the Shenzhen airport. Surprisingly I think I'd adjusted alright to the time change. After 28+ hurs of traveling and a few more family things, we FINALLY got to shower and brush our teeth. It felt so good to be clean!! Just to wash my hair and scrub everything felt SO GOOD. My aunt gave us single-use towels because she didn't trust the hotel-provided ones. My mom found a mandarin-version of the Nationao Geographic show in TV. We ate zhao li (棗李，a variety of the jujube fruit that tastes like a cross between a pear, with a texture and crunch of an apple, and an exterior like an unripe plum) from my uncle. It was super tasty, and we also had a bunch of very sweet blueberries from a clamshell.</p>

<h3>Dinner with family</h3>
<p>My uncle and his wife met us out in the front of the hotel. I didn't know that "Hotel" in Mandarin is Jiǔdiàn (酒店，translates to wine shop) which I was so confused by. A hotel, called an "alcohol spot" I wonder the cultural story behind it. Was it a political policy that caused alcohol to only be able to be purchased at certain locations? I didn't get a chance to ask.</p>
<p>I got to see my uncle's wife after a really long time and I didn't recognize her. She gave me a red envelope with a bunch of money that I've no clue what to do with, but I felt thankful. She's a super elegant lady but with a hidden side it seems. I felt like if she knew I had tattoos then she would act differently around me. Maybe she was so nice because she wants to show up for my uncle, maybe it was because my mom gave her a fancy present.</p>
<p>At the restaurant (which was only a guick walk away from the hotel) we also met up with my aunt and her husband. My cousin (her name is 心心 or XīnXīn, which translates to "heart") was at school, but she called while we were all at dinner. My mom handed the phone to me and she said she wanted to talk to me. I don't know if that was performative either, we haven't talked since literally the last time I was in China, which was maybe 2012. I had THE MOST awkward conversation with her due to us being basically total strangers, and us having nothing in common. I also didn't have enough Chinese vocabulary to try and get to know her. I tried asking her about school but I awkwardly said bye after running out of things to say. I could tell she also felt really awkward and I passed the phone back to my mom.</p>
<p>During the dinner, there was a dish and the waitstaff said the "tofu didn't have meat in it" and technically yes, the tofu didn't CONTAIN meat, but the sauce did and I ate 3 very flavorful slices of tofu before noticing the little chunks of fried meat. I immediately spat out the meat into a napkin and felt really upset, all the while family was aying what a shame it was that I couldn't try all the good foods. I felt so guilty having eaten 3 of the tofu. But the other dishes that were made were confirmed to be vegan.</p>
<p>I had a Sichuan native special vegetable called <a href="#zheergen">Zhe Er Gen</a>. My mom said many people don't like it, and my aunt didn't like it either much, but I really did. My mom loved it as a kid and it tasted like this beef dish I had a long time ago called Fuqi Feipian (夫妻肺片，which translates to, unfortunately, "couple's lung slices"). I made EXTRA sure the veg dish didn't use any animal products/fats. Apparently the meaty taste is in part from the slightly numbing chili-oil spice that's very characteristic of Sichuan (the province that Chengdu is in)'s spic, which consists of a combo of 3 different types of peppers according to my family.
</p>
<p>I also had these sticky glutinous rice squares with brown sugar called Cíbā (糍粑，"ba" means cake), and I ate most of the dish. It was super tasty! But I felt awkward sitting with my family so wanted to keep drinking chrysanthemum tea, but it was all the way by my aunt and her husband.</p>

<h3>The Longemont Hotel</h3>
<p>We walked back to the hotel and my aunt and her husband came up with us to check things out. They admired the view and my mom gave my aunt a handbag that she didn't want my uncle or his wife to see... family politics. Anyways, finally it was time for them to leave and I could breathe a little easier and so I ju7st journaled. My mom boiled some sketchy hotel water and made a horrendous vitamin C drink. I gagged trying to drink it all, but finished and finally went to bed. In the middle of the night, my mom had a work meeting (1:30AM China time) but woke up at 12:30AM because she felt stressed.</p>

<h3>The Longemont Hotel</h3>
<p>Woke up before my alarm and used the restroom, then packed. After we walked out, we met up with my aunt and her husband. We handed him a baggy of things we didn't want to bring along with us and then my mom, aunt, and I went to the station which was RIGHT next to the Hotel.</p>
<h4>Chengdu Dong High Speed Railway Station (成都东站)</h4>
<p>We had 35 minutes until our train, so we went to find coffee and breakfast. My aunt and I walked around while my mom waited for the luggage. We wnded up in a convenience store called Sichuan Flavor Impression. I couldn't read anything but my aunt helped me get a veggie bun (vegan!) and she got herself and my mom two breakfast onigiri. After that we went to KFC (of all places) to get coffee, and they didn't have oat milk. My aunt got herself and my mom lattes and yóutiáo (油条，translates to "oil stick"), and I got an americano with sugar.</p>
<h4>High Speed Rail</h4>
<p>We rushed back to the boarding area where my mom was, and we had to show our passports to board. It was a 2+hr train ride! I sat between my mm and aunt while my mom had to remote-dial into a meeting. She was ultimately unable to take the meeting due to spotty signal on the train though. I got to bond with my aunt a bit showing her all the different fungi pics I had taken over the years. I showed her some of the pots I'd painted and some photos from Iceland. She showed me photos of their family parakeet (named Li Da Zhuang, or "Li big strong") and my cousin's TikTok. Apparently she's super into cosplay, and she's really good too! She likes vocaloids and has also cosplayed as Miku.</p>

<h2>Thursday - March 20, 2025</h2>

<p>My mom and aunt are starting to feel irked by each other. My mom basically funded the entire trip and my aunt was in charge of booking everything (and the remaining money she gets to keep). My mom thinks she cheaped out on a lot of stuff when it didn't need to be that way, like the inn we are staying at is more than a little janky (no toilet-shower separation, location isn't as convenient, headboard has lots of weird cracks and the heating only heats the upper half of the room, and this one and one of the previous ones felt REAL unclean but we gotta stay two days), my aunt is also in charge of paying for everyone's food with the money my mom gave and she gets a little upset when she thinks we're ordering too much food. I've been trying to stay out of it but it genuinely does suck (situation and the inn) and I understand my mom feeling disappointed, my aunt wanting to save, and I just want to pay for my own stuff but can only do so sparingly bc my mom doesn't want my aunt to know how much cash (called RMB or CNY) I brought. Money culture is also super weird with my extended family and many other folks. Just can't wait to get back and not have to deal with family politics. Keeping my head low and just trying to find silver linings, hoping to see some fungi tomorrow...</p>
<p>My mom and I finally got to have a bit of time away from my aunt yesterday and walked into a tea shop where an older uncle had us try his selection.</p>

<p>On the way down the lift we met a guy thought I was 17. My mom and aunt got upset that I didn't lie to him about my age.</p>
<p>Arguing with my mom in the taxi about how to get home from PDX. She wanted me to use Uber and I didn't want to, I wanted either my friend to drive me home and I'd buy dinner in exchange, or I'd take the MAX red line (45mins). She was like, "you just don't want to use Uber because of politics" and I was like "yes but no, they steal your data, plus other reasons" and she was so dismissive and I know it came from a good place but it was frustrating.</p>

<h2>Saturday - March 22, 2025</h2>

<h3>Zhangjiajie</h3>
<p>Veggie buns, bought 2 more for CNY1.5 each with my uncle's red envelope money. My mom explained the math to me (1.5 * 2 is 3) which was so dumb and infantilizing because IT'S BASIC MATH and I KNOW, but it was still frustrating. She was apparently trying to hint and say that I shouldn't break up the bigger bills my uncle gave me without my aunt knowing, but at the cost of me looking like an absolute idiot. I'm bad at math but I'm not THAT bad smh.</p>
<p>Granules in the soybean milk is so pleasant but I had to finish fast at my mom's insistence to avoid taking on the gondola (called the Cableway Box)</p>

<h3>Tianmen Mountain</h3>
<p>Raining, crossed a bridge and tried to eat food on top of the Tianmen structure. There wasn't any food I could eat, and my aunt had tofu that was fried in oil that also had fried meat (and my mom straight up had meat).</p>

<p>Fox spirits are apparently a big hype point in China. So many stories about foxes that have reached some kind of enlightenment stage and turned into (very attractive) people and lured away people into the forest. The Tianmen foothills has an exhibition space dedicated to fox spirit performances, and they even have MASSIVE fox sculptures on top of the event space buildings.</p>
<p>Mountain and wawayu mascots</p>
<p>Bus back, had to sit separately</p>
<p>Restaurant walked, next to hotel. Veeeeery uncomfortable with hanging dried meat at the entrance, but they are able to make things vegan (veggies cooked with vegetable oil). The hostess was the only one taking orders and she was saying everything is super tasty... The tea was supposed to be poured in these horribly flimsy small plastic cups (literally a gentle press made a big dent in them) with no ceramic teacups for some reason. Hāo câo bā bā. Kids playing by the building across from the restaurant at arcade games, flashing lights and I thought it was the backroom of the restaurant, and if it's the kids of the hostess. Wawayu ordered by another table.</p>

<h2>Sunday - March 23, 2025</h2>

<h3>Zhangjiajie</h3>
<p>I tried a local Hunan specialty called Stinky Tofu (which surprisingly didn't stink but my mom said there's a faint aroma). It's very savory and flavorful and it's fermented with soybeans, tempeh, and baking soda (had a moment of panic bc the Taiwanese version uses milk and meats in their fermentation process). Also tried and finished the jackfruit, and THAT was really tasty! Like a fairly rubbery but sweet texture, has a slight aroma of the pink rope bubblegum if you've ever had it (or honestly big league chews) and yet still crunchy. There's a seed that can be popped out in the middle pretty easily!</p>
<p>9 hours train ride...</p>

<h3>Chengdu</h3>
<p>Uncle picked us up, literally could never drive in China. My uncle also keeps calling my by my brother's name. We went to the hotel he booked us and my mom went up first. I went up after her separately because my uncle didn't want the front staff to know we were all together, and then after both me and my mom were in the room he left for home. I could finally, FINALLY use the restroom and take a hot shower at 10:20PM. Gosh it feels so good to get clean!</p>
