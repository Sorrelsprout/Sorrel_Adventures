<h2>Tuesday - March 11, 2025</h2>

<h3>Sunnyvale, CA</h3>
<p>Finished last-minute drafts for OMS and sent them off. My mom and I got into our first shouting match in a while, I had wondered how long it'd take for that to happen... Did some last-minute packing, and went to the bank to take care of an expiring CD. Work wrapped up ok, and then my mom and I took an airport to the SJ Minetta Airport. We got some seriously mediocre bagels at a pla e I don't even want to bother to name, the pickled peppers made me queasy and gave me a stomachache. I got to call my best friend in SoCal a bit before boarding. As we were taking off, I saw the Fremont mountains. I thought, if there was an aircraft malfunction and somehow we got stuck in SJ, that would really suck. Felt my jaw clench and thought of that quote from <a href="http://www.nightinthewoods.com" target="_blank">Night in the Woods</a>, "I'd rather die anywhere else." Coming back to the bay has been mentally taxing enough, but thinking about getting an injury where I'd be trapped there and potentially have to see my dad... that would suck so fucking much. As the bay slowly went away from view so high up (snagged a window seat), I felt my body physically relax more, and started journaling. The flight to LA was decent and short.</p>

<h3>LAX</h3>
<p>Got Panda Express because that was the fastest place with vegan options and I felt my hands shaking from starvation. My mom gets that too but she didn't have that reaction. We sat and ate, and was surprised at how little options there were for such a massive and populated airport for even vegetarians. After that we walked to the gate, and boarding took an hour because it was SO crowded. Luckily during that time I could catch up on messages and charge my phone. I wondered what it'd be like losing access to Google/Reddit/Signal/most everything else I used regularly... supposed that taking photos and texting would be the way to go, like how it was like years ago. Got lucky to have another window seat!</p>

<h2>Wednesday - March 12, 2025</h2>

<h3>Air China to Shenzhen</h3>
<p>We had to exit the gates and go to baggage claim, then re-enter. It was a bit of a struggle. On the flight, had to nap because I was SO tired. Wanted to fall asleep right after eating the Panda Express, I slept from about 11PM to 5:30AM Pacific time, then woke up and opened a written note my friend gave me before I left home. It was fun responding to it, and then I had to use the restroom which was surprisingly cleaner than expected.</p>
<p>The in-flight meal I got ahead of everyone else (I guess they brought out the vegan/dietary restrictive options first. Got curry rice with chickpeas and spinach. There was a thing of bread, a little side salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, and arugula. There was also a little bowl of chopped fruit with half a strawberry, cantaloupe, and pineapple. It was surprisingly good, and the best plane food I've ever had. Very shocked, since the first time I had Chinese plane food it tasted so disturbingly bad. Everything I got looked much better than my mom's (she got some kind of weird mystery meat thing) in her curry. She even admitted that my food looked better, and I offered her some but she didn't take any.</p>
<p>The second in-flight meal we received about 3h 40min prior to landing (13-14hr flight in total). There was fried rice, a muffin, and fruit (grapes and melon). I saved the muffin for later but everything was decently tasty again. I still missed home, but I missed it a bit less since we got so far away from CA.</p>
<p>On the flight, I didn't do much aside from sleep. We passed above bits of Mongolia. I played this in-flight entertainment game called Doudizhu (斗地主，translates to“fight the landlord”). At one point, bothered my mom out of mild boredom and used one of my braids to stroke her arm but it made her remember the time when she went back to China to visit my grandma after she'd passed away and she had a nightmare that night staying where my grandma used to live about an entity with long hair (that she thought was my grandma at first, even though my grandma didn't have long hair IRL) that was really vivid and disturbing. The figure had pounced on her and she started praying to Guanyin, to Jesus, to Whatevergod and the figure started slowly getting smaller and smaller until it shrunk to a small, dark, fetus-like thing and she woke up. She said it was super vivd and could still feel like the figure's hair could stroke her. She had been sleeping on the couch of where my grandma and my grandma's sister-in-law had lived, and had to actually move to sleep in the same bed as the sis in law because she was so horrified and scared. So I felt really guilty about that and never did it again.</p>
<p>Can't imagine how it must have felt and wish I had the capacity to carry her mental health too, even with all of our not seeing eye-to-eye-ness. I wished I had the capacity to be a better daughter... thugh I guess by me going on this trip I could do some of that. I can see my mom as a human being with flaws, as someone who used to be a child, who has lived a very different life than I have in a way that I haven't been able to acknowledge when I was younger. I want her to not feel bad even if I don;'t agree on many things with her. These incongruencies while still trying to keep my own mental health stable feels so volatile and it's uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>Thursday - March 13, 2025</h2>
<h3>Shenzhen Airport to Chengdu</h3>
<p>We had a 3h layover and had to enter the border control area with passport and fingerprint verification, and also fill out a form as to why we're traveling and when we'll return. My hands were so dry that my fingerprints didn't register, and a guard had to spray my hand with water to make the scan work. After that we went to pick up our baggage and had to go through a security checkpoint again. After re-entering we werre in a massive atrium and there were lots of bougie duty-free shops for perfumes and purses and such and folks aggressively trying to get places. Quite a few pushed past my mom who was trying to patiently wait to talk to the info desk lady... maybe this is a slice of culture shock?</p>
<p>After that we went to our gate but along the way we tried to find food/coffee. There was a place for jianbing and passionfruit tea called the <a href="https://www.szairport.com/szairporten/tscy/202310/43844ed108724fc28fab97a442fe777f.shtml" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">The Pancake and Tea</a> and this lady at the shop was using this cool T-shaped tool to make super delicious-looking jianbing, with lettuce, seasoning, and crispy crackers inside. It made me really miss and crave <a href="https://www.bingmipdx.com" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">Bing Mi</a> in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hbCYTRiK94mc1weq7" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">NW Portland</a>. If only the one we saw was vegan... the stand didn't even have any veggie options! We ended up getting two passionfruit green tea drinks. They were pretty tasty ajd not too sweet, and the seeds had a nice crunch to them. But when my mom tried to pay, the shopkeep pressed the button for American dollars instead of Chinese Yen and luckily my mom caught it. My mom had to verify if the vendor was trying to charge CNY or USD in case they were trying to scam us, especially since the vendor seemed a little shady (averted eye contact, repeatedly putting off an air of dismissiveness when my mom asked to see the charge screen of the tapping-pay system) with their mannerisms. She was pretty pissed and asked the shopkeep to redo it, and confirmed to pay in CNY instead. CNY32 is roughly $5 in American currency, and that was for 2 drinks, so $32 would have been about 15+ drinks, crazytown! After that, we sat aroung the gate waiting to board, and I tried to download Alipay so I could pay for things too, but the signal was awful. While we were waiting for the plane to Chengdu too, I had to use the bathroom. It was... unfortunately the squat toilets. I <em>despise</em> the squat toilets SO much.</p>

<h3>Flight to Chgengdu</h3>
<p>On the flight I don't know why but I still felt so exhausted. Napped more and woke up when our air hostess came by and asked what food we wanted. Another meal! But this time it was "breakfast" and they didn't have anything fully vegan. They had a vegetarian option but I couldn't have the bread (contained egg) or the drinkable yogurt, so I swapped those with my mom for her fruit (cantaloupe slices). There was also tea. As we were waiting for food, these overhead videos started playing and there was this advertisement on deerskins, which was pretty sickening. My mom said it was the culture of the folks in the video to hunt, and while I'm sure it's a very special and cultural practice, and the video was cinematic, it was disturbing to think of those poor deer. It was also unsettling to hear my mom's cognitive dissonance, knowing that an animal was harmed yet not acknowledging the pain/disturbing treatment of the corpse's skin. The flight was at least in daytime and I could see the clouds. I've gotten the window seat for 4 flights in a row, pretty lucky!</p>

<h3>Chengdu</h3>
<p>My uncle picked us up from the airport. The Chengdu airport was apparently constructed during the pandemic according to my mom, and my uncle drove us to his condo. Along the way I texted folks back (and got a little carsick) and looked out the window. There were There were so many massively tall buildings and a surprisingly cool amount of nature around, lots of dense yellow flowers called you cai (油菜，translates to "oil vegetable") and I even saw some tulip clusters! There were also SO many motorbikes and scooters.</p>
<p>My uncle briefly asked what I could/couldn't eat and asked if I could have food made with animal fats, and I heard my mom tell him in a hushed tone tell him not to bring it up. But I HEARD it. I had to remain vigilant and not consume any animal products... I was worried because we were going to dinner after that with more family. My uncle was a real road rager too, and he uses some REAL colorful swears. It's funny and terrifying at the same time, though he really is an excellent driver maneuvering around all the crowds of drivers. Driving in China is D&nbsp;I&nbsp;F&nbsp;F&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;E&nbsp;N&nbsp;T.</p>

<h3>Uncle's Condo</h3>
<p>When we got to his condo we also met up with my aunt. It was a little awkward and honestly I only semi-recognized my extended family. My aunt noted how much I look like my mom and I was just thankful she didn't mention my dad. Does my aunt even know? I also worry deep down that I'll carry the hardness and undesirable qualities that my mom has, and I don't want to be like either of my parents.</p>
<p>We went up to my uncle's place which was on the 7th floor of one of the numerous tall structures. His view is amazing! So much nature below, and he also keeps snake plants.We opened up the luggages and my mom distributed presents and such, for my aunt, uncle, their families, and other folks too. There was some hiding of presents going on because my mom didn't want my aunt to know how she got a specific thing for my uncle's wife, and also vice versa. So much family politics. I don't want my brother to have to deal with any of that shit, secrets suck but I guess it's necessary at times?</p>
<p>Anyways, I mainly just looked at my uncle's fish tank. It looked really sad, the fish had nowhere to hide and there was no greenery or anything and the tank was quite small for SO many fish. I ate a few bananas and passion fruits that my uncle gave me. The passion fruits were cool and tasty, instead of a brown exterior it was yellow, and I mistook them for wonky-looking lemons at first. After helping re-pack, we departed and my uncle drove us to our hotel.</p>

<h3>The Longemont Hotel</h3>
<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.longemonthotels-chengdu.com/en" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">Longemont Hotel</a> on the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/MddtjSkcHJaQHn167" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">39th floor</a>! It was sooo high up and it looks pretty sleek, though the wallpaper was peeling, someone was smoking somewhere (so we had to close the open window) and we couldn't find any temperature controls in the room at first so it was very toasty (but we found it eventually). They had american-style toilets!! I got so worried when I saw the squat-style toilets at the Shenzhen airport. Surprisingly I think I'd adjusted alright to the time change. After 28+ hurs of traveling and a few more family things, we FINALLY got to shower and brush our teeth. It felt so good to be clean!! Just to wash my hair and scrub everything felt SO GOOD. My aunt gave us single-use towels because she didn't trust the hotel-provided ones. My mom found a mandarin-version of the Nationao Geographic show in TV. We ate zhao li (棗李，a variety of the jujube fruit that tastes like a cross between a pear, with a texture and crunch of an apple, and an exterior like an unripe plum) from my uncle. It was super tasty, and we also had a bunch of very sweet blueberries from a clamshell.</p>

<h3>Dinner with family</h3>
<p>My uncle and his wife met us out in the front of the hotel. I didn't know that "Hotel" in Mandarin is Jiǔdiàn (酒店，translates to wine shop) which I was so confused by. A hotel, called an "alcohol spot" I wonder the cultural story behind it. Was it a political policy that caused alcohol to only be able to be purchased at certain locations? I didn't get a chance to ask.</p>
<p>I got to see my uncle's wife after a really long time and I didn't recognize her. She gave me a red envelope with a bunch of money that I've no clue what to do with, but I felt thankful. She's a super elegant lady but with a hidden side it seems. I felt like if she knew I had tattoos then she would act differently around me. Maybe she was so nice because she wants to show up for my uncle, maybe it was because my mom gave her a fancy present.</p>
<p>At the restaurant (which was only a guick walk away from the hotel) we also met up with my aunt and her husband. My cousin (her name is 心心 or XīnXīn, which translates to "heart") was at school, but she called while we were all at dinner. My mom handed the phone to me and she said she wanted to talk to me. I don't know if that was performative either, we haven't talked since literally the last time I was in China, which was maybe 2012. I had THE MOST awkward conversation with her due to us being basically total strangers, and us having nothing in common. I also didn't have enough Chinese vocabulary to try and get to know her. I tried asking her about school but I awkwardly said bye after running out of things to say. I could tell she also felt really awkward and I passed the phone back to my mom.</p>
<p>During the dinner, there was a dish and the waitstaff said the "tofu didn't have meat in it" and technically yes, the tofu didn't CONTAIN meat, but the sauce did and I ate 3 very flavorful slices of tofu before noticing the little chunks of fried meat. I immediately spat out the meat into a napkin and felt really upset, all the while family was aying what a shame it was that I couldn't try all the good foods. I felt so guilty having eaten 3 of the tofu. But the other dishes that were made were confirmed to be vegan.</p>
<p>I had a Sichuan native special vegetable called <a href="#zheErGen">Zhé 'Ěr Gēn</a>. My mom said many people don't like it, and my aunt didn't like it either much, but I really did. My mom loved it as a kid and it tasted like this beef dish I had a long time ago called Fuqi Feipian (夫妻肺片，which translates to, unfortunately, "couple's lung slices"). I made EXTRA sure the veg dish didn't use any animal products/fats. Apparently the meaty taste is in part from the slightly numbing chili-oil spice that's very characteristic of Sichuan (the province that Chengdu is in)'s spic, which consists of a combo of 3 different types of peppers according to my family.
</p>
<p>I also had these sticky glutinous rice squares with brown sugar called Cíbā (糍粑，"ba" means cake), and I ate most of the dish. It was super tasty! But I felt awkward sitting with my family so wanted to keep drinking chrysanthemum tea, but it was all the way by my aunt and her husband.</p>

<h3>The Longemont Hotel</h3>
<p>We walked back to the hotel and my aunt and her husband came up with us to check things out. They admired the view and my mom gave my aunt a handbag that she didn't want my uncle or his wife to see... family politics. Anyways, finally it was time for them to leave and I could breathe a little easier and so I ju7st journaled. My mom boiled some sketchy hotel water and made a horrendous vitamin C drink. I gagged trying to drink it all, but finished and finally went to bed. In the middle of the night, my mom had a work meeting (1:30AM China time) but woke up at 12:30AM because she felt stressed.</p>

<h2>Friday - March 14, 2025</h2>

<h3>The Longemont Hotel</h3>
<p>Today's an adventure day! Woke up before my alarm and used the restroom, then packed. After we walked out, we met up with my aunt and her husband. We handed him a baggy of things we didn't want to bring along with us and then my mom, aunt, and I went to the station which was RIGHT next to the Hotel.</p>
<h4>Chengdu Dong High Speed Railway Station (成都东站)</h4>
<p>We had 35 minutes until our train, so we went to find coffee and breakfast. My aunt and I walked around while my mom waited for the luggage. We wnded up in a convenience store called Sichuan Flavor Impression. I couldn't read anything but my aunt helped me get a veggie bun (vegan!) and she got herself and my mom two breakfast fàn tuán (饭团, translates to "rice ball" which is like an onigiri). After that we went to KFC (of all places) to get coffee, and they didn't have oat milk. My aunt got herself and my mom lattes and yóutiáo (油条，translates to "oil stick"), and I got an americano with sugar.</p>
<h4>High Speed Rail</h4>
<p>We rushed back to the boarding area where my mom was, and we had to show our passports to board. It was a 2+hr train ride! I sat between my mm and aunt while my mom had to remote-dial into a meeting. She was ultimately unable to take the meeting due to spotty signal on the train though. I got to bond with my aunt a bit showing her all the different fungi pics I had taken over the years. I showed her some of the pots I'd painted and some photos from Iceland. She showed me photos of their family parakeet (named Li Da Zhuang, or "Li big strong") and my cousin's TikTok. Apparently she's super into cosplay, and she's really good too! She likes vocaloids and has also cosplayed as Miku.</p>

<h3>Huanglong</h3>
<p>We headed to Huánglóng fēngjǐng qū (黄龙风景区，translates to Huanglong scenic area). After arriving at the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303772-d29004499-Reviews-Huanglong_Jiuzhai_Railway_Station-Songpan_County_Ngawa_Tibetan_and_Qiang_Autonom.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Huanglong-Jiuzhai Railway Station</a> via the high-speed train. We took the elevator up to the entrance and it was a lot colder than expected and though it wasn't snowing, there was snow everywhere. My mom and aunt went to use the restrom whike I watched the bags and did my darndest to avoid these guys that kept going around offering taxi/transport services. After they came back I also went to use it and it was pretty gross, just... squat toilets with suspicious water everywhere and it smelled really bad. Walked to the aerial tram where we rode to almost the top and my aunt bought sugar water.</p>
<p>We walked the rest of the way up and along the way used these AWFUL restrooms, like there was literally u8ncovered shit and the DOORS WOULDN'T CLOSE. And of course they were squat toilets again and it was so faul smelling. But after that I wiped my hands extra thoroughly with two alcohol wipes (there were no sinks). We ate some tangerines and then set off. My aunt also had us take these pills that prevent elevation sickness. I did feel lightheaded and chest tightness at times, but my mom felt worse. We stopped at times and also walked slower.</p>
<p>We got to the highest point and there were these stunningly light blue-colored pools of mineral water. There was a temple but we couldn't enter it. We stayed and took pictures, and it was really breathtaking. After that we descended I tried to look for fungi. I saw what could have been <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/265335478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wood ear</a> and a <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/265335296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">small shelf fungus</a>. We saw more pools and I listened to music, walking a bit behind my mom and aunt. I saw many pinaceae, with bark beetle evidence too, but no <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/118055-Cryptoporus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cryptoporus</a>. We walked along the wooden platform trails and kept at it all the way down to the very beginning (only took the lift up and not back), and the further down we walked the warmer it got. The total walk was <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/china/sichuan/huanglong-hike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9+mi there and back</a>!</p>

<h3>Bus</h3>
<p>After we got to where we stored the luggage, we grabbed them from this wooden cabin structure thety were stored in (my aunt got a luggage receipt tag). We then boarded a tall bus with yellow curtains. It was a very honk-friendly bus, and the road was long and windy. I was worried that I'd get carsick so stared out the window with music. We passed by a lot of long-haired cows and cow poop, a bunches of tibetan prayer flags strung along buildings and poles, country folks going about their lives in well-worn earth-colored clothing, and a Sichuan-Tibetan hospital.</p>
<p>We stopped at a stand selling cattle meat which was disturbing, since they had a very sweet and gentle long-haired cow outside and meandering around (likely as an advertisement). We did enter the store and stretch our legs, and there was a significan selection of exorbantly-priced snacks. They also sold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallus_indusiatus"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bridal veil fungus</a> and dried morels.</p>
<p>After re-boarding the bus and continuing, there were a lot of mini-stops dropping folks off, very quirky-looking buildings and some with gaudy-looking exteriors, and massive vegas-like yet cheap-looking decor. Everything looked slightly run-down and there were many buildings that looked half-constructed or abandoned, and even structures that looked ALMOST like abandoned amusement park, like <a href="https://nolightingnecessary.blogspot.com/2014/08/depiction-and-fiction-epilogue.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dreamland</a> in Paprika.</p>

<h3>Motel</h3>
<p>After we got more settled, my aunt brought out an infrared light to detect hidden cameras. We didn't find anything suspicious, but never opened the window because there was some weird construction going on outside. We were facing another building which formed an alley. The room had neither a TV nor a fridge, but had a badly-painted peach-colored custom ceiling and a projector that connected to nothing. Of all the things it DID have, it had a very fancy UV-lit sanitizing toilet with a heated seat, which I was so thankful for. The seat itself was a little wobbly, but gosh, NO SQUAT TOILET!!</p>
<p>We then left to get dinner and ended up at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vEChV8pUCvRFSPeUA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chongqing Dan Dan Mian</a> (重庆担担面) which was right next door-ish. They had <a href="https://redhousespice.com/chongqing-noodles/#recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chongqing Xiao Mian</a> (重庆小面), which were Chongqing-styled noodles (a soice on the dry-hot side) which were very good but not so intense that I couldn't eat it. My mom got the same and we confirmed that they use vegetable oils completely for frying. My aunt got a meat noodle dish, but we also ordered these garlic-fried vegetables (partial translation 地菜，xūan róng dāng dì cài) that the employee said used to be foraged in a nearby mountain, but it was overharvested so they started cultivating it. They tasted really good, like a mixture of bok choi and <a href="#youCai">yóu cài</a> (油菜, translates to "oil vegetable"). After that we went back to the motel and I was able to get washed up, and caught up on messages/journaling.</p>

<!-- D A Y : 5 ---------------------------------------->

<h2>Saturday - March 15, 2025</h2>
<h3>Motel</h3>
<p>Woke up, replied to friends, went to the restroom, braided my hair, and did some more journaling. It was about 4:45AM China Standard Time. My aunt woke up and tested iut the projector but wasn't able to get it to work. We then ate at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vEChV8pUCvRFSPeUA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chongqing Dan Dan Mian</a> restaurant we were at yesterday and got <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1mdwz5q/qingke_bing_soft_chewy_with_a_natural_grain_flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Qīngkē Bing</a> (青稞，translates to hulless barley), yóutiáo, and xiǎomǐ zhōu (小米粥，translates to millet congee), which were all really tasty and filling. On the way out we saw a pregnant dog hovering around the place next door and I really wanted to go pet her and say hi. The shopkeep looked like she was going to shoo her away, but didn't since my mom and I were saying "aww" at her. But then my aunt hailed a taxi and we had to board, so that was that. The taxi's back seats were SO hard to buckle in. I got mine set and then helped my mom.</p>

<h3>Jiuzhai Valley National Park</h3>
<p>Jiǔzhàigōu (九寨沟). A short while later we got to the Jiǔzhàigōu entrance. Apparently there were 8000+ folks trying to visit this day, and people were so aggressive and pushy rushing in! We were trying to figure out which of the 6-ish lines took passports.</p>

<h4>Arrow Bamboo Lake</h4>
<p>At Arrow Bamboo Lake (箭竹海，Jiànzhú Hǎi), the "trails" are all made of sturdy wood planks and no cars were allowed on the roads, only buses. It was odd, there wasn't a single runner/jogger. "箭竹 (jiànzhú)" translates to bamboo, and "海 (hǎi)" translates to "ocean." It was so beautiful going into the park, it was all snowy with the trees. It was interesting seeing the outfits that the other visitors were wearing. Lots of fake/off-brand logos on things and cutesty charms and characters on ladies' clothes. Many ladies also had their pictures taken by their partners and a surprising number of peole in dresses.</p>

<h4>Tourist Landings</h4>
<p>Finally got more context on the dress-up situation. There were many pop-up tourist stands/tents for Tibetian-style dress-up outfits. Many of the visitor women wore the themed outfits from the stands and had their makeup done in such a way to be an "aestheticized" Tibetian country person. Their makeup looked similar to the style that many Twitch streamer influencers had. My mom asked if I wanted to do it too, and that my cousin had done it, but I said no. It felt like cultural appropriation if I were to participate, especially with the makeup (they'd also paint clouds on the cheeks of folks, with sparkles. I know nothinbg about Tibetan culture and I'd wager that most of the folks dressing up didn't either, though maybe they do... might be best not to assume. MY cousin and aunt also know little to nothing about Tibetan culture too when I asked). But it felt like an uncomfortable and insensitive activity to partake in as a foreigner, and it felt weird they were making bank off tourists. I didn't know for certain if the people running the stands were Tibetan at all either.</p>

<h4>Five Flower Lake</h4>
<p>This was the second viewpoint, the lake looked pretty and was brilliantly blue. I want to do more research on the mineral content. It was wintertime so we didn't see any of the "Five Flowers." The "Five Flowers" refer to the different types of algae colors/distribution within the lake. We also saw some fish. I helped a lady take photos and she also took some of me when I wandered a distance from my mom and aunt. She seemed really happy with the ones I took of her and that made me happy.</p>

<h4>Colorful Lake</h4>
<p>It was really pretty, the sun came out and we could see more colors here.</p>

<h4>Mirror Lake</h4>
<p>This scenic area had particularly beautiful reflections. I listened to "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1elhmWW7Bv0MOQj2gAsyoV?si=f27299e8fa4d4797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Make You Say</a>" on repeat, not because it fit the vibe, but because it was one of the only songs I had downloaded.</p>

<h4>Pearl Shoal Waterfall</h4>
<p>Apparently one of significance to the Monkey King live action show. The Monkey King legend itself has been adapted many many times in media, and I used to watch it as a cartoon series as a kid, though I've never seen the live action, and the figures seemed a bit creepy.</p>

<h4>Central Connection Food Point</h4>
<p>Sweet potato. There was a VERY chonky wild(?) cat.</p>

<h4>Nuorilang Waterfall</h4>
<p>Nuorilang (诺日朗瀑布). Saw an Agaricales mushroom here and I got really excited, the first full capped mushroom we saw! There were a lot of native plant plaques under the bridge.</p>

<h4>Long Lake</h4>
<p>This lake area is another part of the Five Flower Lake, and it was frozen over. Helped a couple take photos. We saw cosplayers and my aunt seemed a little disapproving of them. I felt pretty fed up with the tourist marketers that were trying to get people to rent/dress up in Tibetan outfits. They kept trying to get me to dress up and "become pretty". I told one of the particularly insistent ones "Don't you already think I'm pretty?" meaning I don't need their makeup, and my mom started laughing, and the lady paused for half a second then was like "yeah which is why you should dress up" and kept marketing, but I kept walking. We saw <a href="#redBirch">Red Birch Trees</a> (Betula albosinensis var. burkill).</p>

<h4>Colorful Pond</h4>
<p>It was indeed very colorful. Someone formed a duck made of snow on the wood railing. The pond was smaller than expected but was very blue.</p>

<h4>Central Connection Point</h4>
<p>There were tons of vendors for toys, cheap-looking jewelry, gaudily-designed magnets, fuzzy synthetic fiber hats, and knickknacks everywhere. There were more Tibetan-style make-up outfit stands featuring photos of women with overly-done faces and enlarged eyes, and it all felt so fake.</p>

<h4>Nuo Ri Lang LvYou FuWu JiuCan Qu</h4>
<p>We had lunch at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303770-d6643477-Reviews-Nuo_Ri_Lang_LvYou_FuWu_JiuCan_Qu-Jiuzhaigou_County_Ngawa_Tibetan_and_Qiang_Autono.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nuo Ri Lang LvYou FuWu JiuCan Qu</a>. They didn't have any fully vegan options so my aunt helped me ask for some custom-made noodles made with vegetable oil and broth, and I added a bit too much black vinegar. It still tasted very good and I drank all the broth. Apparently my noodles costed more than both my mom and aunt's meals combined. I vigorously thanked my aunt and felt bad for the inconvenience, but I know I would feel worse if I knowingly consumed animal products. We sat in a food court area with these very used-looking pink chair coverings that also looked really gaudy. The tables used plastic single-sheet table cloths.</p>

<h4>Rhinoceros Lake</h4>
<p>It was super impossibly blue. There was a tourist stand and they were advertising food/beverage/goods in Sun WuKong (the Monkey King)'s voice, and it cracked me and my mom up. IT just sounded so silly. I sent a video clip of it to my brother.</p>

<h4>Tiger Lake</h4>
<p>Really colorfu with algae.</p>

<h4>Shuzheng Waterfall</h4>
<p>Very pretty walk along a river, but my legs were SO tired already. I took notice of juniper trees and got better at ID'ing them. Saw a Tibetan prayer wheel and we took the bus to the next sign.</p>

<h4>Sparkling Lake</h4>
<p>A small but very blue lake. Very short distance from Double Dragon Lake.</p>

<h4>Double Dragon Lake</h4>
<p>Probably the bluest patch of lake we saw. I couldn't tell where the two dragons were but the lake itself was much smaller than the others we saw. It also had a waterfall. We walked a bit more until we reached Reed lake, and my mom wanted to see a bit more of it while my aunt and I slowly walked back. My legs were SO sore. According to my aunt we walked around 12mi! That's over 20mi this weekend.</p>
<p>On the way out we saw some folks petting a cat! I really wanted to pet the cat too but my mom said no. I was gonna do it but the fear of possibly needing medical attention, infection, and germs really turned me off.</p>

<h4>Exiting</h4>
<p>At the end there were announcers saying to avoid scams and not to buy any trinkets or fruit, while fruit vendors were right there harrassing folks to buy their trinkets and fruit! There was a guy tryig to get us to ride in his taxi, saying that people under 18 get rides half off. I guess I was in braids but really I thought I looked older than 18.</p>
<p>The bus we ended up taking beeped at passers-by that it would be the last bus out of the park. At the entrance after getting off the bus, I told my mom I was homesick. I mentioned in English so my aunt wouldn't get offended that I wished I had more alone time. My mom then said "If you want so much alone time, why were you upset when your ex wanted alone time?" which was incredibly unfair and hurtful, and I thought it was a messed up thing for her to say. I don't want to just log the good, but the bad bits of this trip too. Since Tuesday, I've not left my mom's side (even at the motel we're sharing a bed and she snores SO loudly too, so much that I use earplugs but I still put up with it) except to use the restroom. With my ex I wasnt seeing him for days at a time and he was a romantic partner, a totally different situation with my mom. I've resorted to listening to the SAME songs that I managed to download, while walking behind my mom and aunt. I just feel so exhausted and there's sti;l a week and a half to go. I miss Portland so much.</p>
<p>We saw a monkey and panda sculpture up on some wall at the entrance and the panda looked like it was shitting. There was also a restaurant with a shopkeep that was advertising their foods. We walked back to the motel but wanted to get dinner first.</p>


<h3>Sichuan Old Taste Restaurant</h3>
<p>We stopped at Sichuan Lao Wei Dao (四川老味道, translates to "Sichuan Old Taste") restaurant and asked the shop if they. cook things in vegetable oil, and they do! We all sat down and I noticed the plates/cups/etc. were duper packaged in plastic, maybe for sanitation purposes? Maybe they just got them shipped? I'd never seen that before. Didn't comprehend until later but there was so much plastic use, if it was just to give a perception of cleanliness as my aunt speculated.</p>
<p>We got mapo tofu, sān xiān tāng (三仙汤, "Three Saints Soup"), <a href="#tongHaoCai">tóng hāo cài</a> (茼蒿菜, chrysanthemom greens) with garlic, and cíbā (糍粑). I didn't like tóng hāo cài as a kid, but as an adult taste profiles change, and on trying it this time I liked it. My aunt seemed like she was in a funk and though we ordered a lot of food, she didn't really eat that much. Apparently she didn't like tóng hāo cài but she didn't say anything against ordering it? She also ordered this beef dish with leeks and her and my mom barely touched it. I tried to hurriedly stuff myself with SO much food so as not to waste anything, but the beef dish was barely touched and definitely wasted. It felt bad. MY aunt also didn't have much of the soup since she doesn't like king oyster mushrooms, so I basically drank all of that too. She just sat there playing a mobile phone game. We had to take the Cíbā cakes to go, and the restaurant tried to charge twice for the soup. We then walked back to the hotel.</p>
<p>The cost of the meal was about CNY190, which my mom said is about $20-30. All that food for b basically the price of a semi-fancy meal in Portland! And such tasty food too. The cost of living is a lot lower in China but also that means my aunt might have been upset if she thought the food was too pricey.</p>

<h3>Hotel</h3>
<p>After we dodged some more hat/mittens/rainjacket sellers we meandered back to the motel. It was really cold outside. My mom wouldn't let me shower immediately since we just ate. According to her (and the internet), "hot water diverts blood flow from your stomach to your skin for cooling, potentially slowing digestion, causing cramps, bloating, or sluggishness, and interfering with nutrient absorption, especially after heavy meals." So I just journaled some and then tidied up. But when I finally COULD shower, gosh it felt SO good to be clean... finally could wash my hair and everything in hot water... I just miss my home.</p>
<p>After getting clean it was my mom's turn to wash up and so I was left alone with my aunt. I felt a little awkward because she had mentioned (a bit snidely) that I seemed to take a while to speak Mandarin. I mean, she wasn't wrong that it was apparent I took some time to translate my thoughts from English to Mandarin, but the way she said it, it was halfway between an observation and passive-aggressiveness, which didn't feel good. The only person I speak Mandarin to is my mom anyways, and it's not like my aunt speaks English. I'm not trying to hide that my Mandarin isn't very good, but I CAN communicate, and I didn't say anything to her when she said that except for "yes." Kill 'em with kindness and agreeability. Anyways I tried hard to make conversation about native plants and foods in China (specifically Chengdu) but my aunt said she didn't really like to cook, and that as the youngest of three (my mom is the oldest sister, then my uncle is the middle child), they tended to do a lot more and she never had to worry about cooking. She mentioned she didn't like foreign cuisines as much because she liked familiar flavors, but she elaborated on the different names of <a href="#zheErGen">Zhé 'Ěr Gēn</a> which was insightful.</p>
<p>After that we talked about me being part of a group that goes around supporting small food businesses (NW Veg and Portland Metro Veggies) though I didn't mention them by name to her. MY aunt said that eating at places occasionally didn't seem like a very effective way to support a business and that it seemed like only a temporary money boost to places. I said that was partially valid, but it was also a way for the group to eat/spend time together, and soon after went to bed. </p>

<h2>Sunday - March 16, 2025</h2>
<p>Today's a travel day! I woke up at about 4:45AM and couldn't get back to sleep, so I replied to messages and went to the bathroom. At about 6:50AM my mom and aunt woke up and started packing up/organizing things.</p>
<p>We went to the Chongqing Dan Dan Mian spot for breakfast again and got congee, with 2 Qīngkē bǐng (青稞饼, translates to "barley cake" and is traditionally made from Highland Barley which is a Tibetan staple grain). My aunt got a Lǔ dàn (卤蛋, a traditional spice-marinated egg). We dunked the leftover cíbā in the congee to warm it up and it was pretty good.</p>
<p>After that we went to get coffee at Luckin Coffee (which in a sleepy passing state looked like "Fucking Coffee"), though it turned out to be UNluckin Coffee since the place was closed for the day even though it should have been open. My aunt suggested KFC Coffee again but the KFC wasn't open either (which I was kind of relieved by.) We also tried to go to a milk tea place called Chagee, but the teas that contained milk ciuoldn't be made hot. It was -3°C out and FREEZING. There were small bits of snow falling and we ducked inside of an eventspace/lobby that Chagee was connected to. The building was super colorful but in a half-finished gaudy kind of way. The entire motel strip zone felt like that. The paint was flaking off in different spots, painted plaster-like extrusions were chipping, and the whole area felt vaguely abandoned. It stirred something in me, striking some kind of drive to explore, if I wasn't so worried of mold, breakage, or cold. At least it was warm. My mom and I used the public restroom in the next building over and it was... alright. The sink felt dirty though and didn't work, so we used packaged alcohol-soaked wet wipes to clean our hands and went back to the lobby area where a few more folks had also gathered to wait. My feet, all socked and booted up, were still freezing. We finally were able to board the bus. There were two white guys with their Chinese GFs which stood out, there weren't many non-Chinese folks even if it is a tourist area.</p>
<p>We headed back using the public transport route we took to get to Jiǔzhàigōu. I wanted to look outside for the 2hr+ ride, but ended up falling asleep next to my mom from being so tired.</p>

<h3>Train station</h3>
<p>High-speed train again! We got to the train station and then had to wait a long while until the train could take off. My mom waited by the luggage and my aunt and I went to get coffee from Cotti Coffee, which we were trying to find but didn't figure out where to go. There was so much cigarette smoke. A voice announcer kept advertising coffee in a secondary train rest station and we finally found it, and I also got to use the restroom there, which was much cleaner. I got a half-sweetened oatmnilk latte and my aunt got a matcha. She also suggested we buy more snacks, and I picked out regular and strawberry-flavored Chinese Oreos after my aunt read the ingredients, and my aunt got some chocolate croissants for her and my mom.</p>
<p>After we finally got into the station and passed baggage check/monitoring, we stood around for a while more. There was a Chinese guy wearing a MAGA hat, and one of my uncle's insults came to mind (死农民). Not very nice but perhaps appropriate. My aunt went to buy a smoked sausage snack for herself and yogurt for my mom, then we had to pass through another passport/ID check and could finally board.</p>
<p>On the train, my mom and I tried the strawberry oreos (which were surprisingly good) and I journaled. I replied to some messages from friends and got a bit carsick (trainsick?). The oatmilk latte really started to9 kick in and I heard some people were coughing, so I masked up. I sat in the middle between my mom and aunt, and my aunt watched TikToks whike my mom read on her tablet. We passed by <a href="#youCai">yóu cài</a> fields. We each ate two tangerines. My aunt mentioned the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_Zha_(2019_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ne Zha</a> and said I should watch it. MY mom had seen it in theaters. I had previously written it off as a janky cartoony kiddie movie but maybe one day I'll get around to it.</p>

<h3>Chengdu Dong High Speed Railway Station (成都东站)</h3>
<p>There was again SO much cigarette smoke. Immediately after getting off the train people started pulling out cigs left right and center, it was rough, We met up briefly with my cousin (Aunt's daughter) and she passed us a baggy of food. She looks so different (so tall!) from how I expected, and we only briefly said "hi" and then we had to go. I was so nervous of potentially needing to make conversation but I didn't actually have to do that.</p>
<p>We entered the station proper and passed by a bunch of military boys and men dressed in camo. We got to the B21 area where we needed to go, and my mom and I went to use the restroom (thankfully it was clean) after setting down our bags with my aunt. After that I went with my aunt to grab some food. We went to the same Ziwei convenience store and got a bowl of meat/egg/rice for my mom and a fàn tuán for my aunt, and two steamed veggie buns for me. While waiting for the staff to heat up the rice bowl and fàn tuán, my aunt went to use the restroom and I texted friends back. She was gone for quite a bit of time and I got a little nervous, but after she came back we went through the passport/ID check and boarded.</p>
<p>The train ride to Xi'An was 3+ hrs long. There were so many fields of <a href="#youCai">yóu cài</a>, beautiful yellow flowers outside the window. My mom let me have the window seat this time. I ate the two veggie bao and also two tofu snacks. My cousin actually got us jiāo yán sū" (椒盐苏, translates to "pepper and salt crisps"), which are also called Táo sū (桃酥 translates to "walnut crisps") which are probably my favorite type of cookie. They're savory rather than sweet, and I love taking a bite and sucking on it, and have had it every time I've been to China or when my family has come back with it from a visit trip.</p>
<p>I kept listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2tpRZklN0uvyBGXxeSGsKI?si=39b738c393de4ea3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Falling Out of Like</a> by Sasha Sloan and Ruston Kelly on repeat after trying to search for anything else to listen to that I'd downloaded. I don't have any experiences related to the lyrics of that song, but it makes me hurt and well up with an awful melancholy.</p>
<p>I wondered what it'd be to host my cousin at my place, even maybe book an anime convention ticket so that she'd have fun. Introduce her to my friend who speaks Mandarin, take her to Yuan Su Vegetarian, and the actual Chinese Garden in downtown Portland. Just to get to know her better even if I feel awkward... maybe as a graduation present or a bonding activity? I haven't really spent time with my extended family before. Imagining it feels burdensome but maybe it'd be a good thing. I don't know, my mind wanders. I just felt guilty about being on this trip and receiving my aunt's hospitality, appreciative of the opportunity, and also like I haven't done enough for family, even though my insides are conflicted. For some reason I want to be a good and cool niece even though I really don't know my family all that much and there's no guarantee my cousin would even have any fun. Maybe she, like her momn, might not like foreign food. Getting hungry while journaling and the song makes me feel lost and displaced... It doesn't fit the vibe but it's hard to stop listening. I just want to sit on my couch at home and strum Betty. I feel trapped, but kept thinking "I don't want to die here."</p>
<p>I listened to music basically the whole way to Xi'An. I don't think my aunt jnows what happened with my dad, but earlier my mom and aunt were talking about facial features and how my cousin only kind of looks like my aunt. My aunt said I generally look like my mom but my eyes were like my dad's. I don't like that, and wish I hadn't heard it. My eyes used to be a part of me that I was relatively ok with but I'll probably think of her words when I look in a mirror now. I don't think they actually do but shit like that is hard to unhear. I started listening to my other playlist and worked on website volunteering work for the <a href="https://www.wildmushrooms.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Oregon Mycological Society</a> by hand-drawing layouts.</p>

<h3>Xi'An</h3>
<p>when we arrived it was smoky with cigarettes outside. And smog perhaps. We struggled a bit trying to locate the taxi that my aunt booked. We passed by a very colorful lit-up rainbow building and got to the motel.</p>

<h4>Xī Yǔ Motel</h4>
<p>We got to the Xī yǔ (西雨, translates to "west rain") hotel. It was quite swanky.</p>

<h2>Thursday - March 20, 2025</h2>

<p>My mom and aunt are starting to feel irked by each other. My mom basically funded the entire trip and my aunt was in charge of booking everything (and the remaining money she gets to keep). My mom thinks she cheaped out on a lot of stuff when it didn't need to be that way, like the inn we are staying at is more than a little janky (no toilet-shower separation, location isn't as convenient, headboard has lots of weird cracks and the heating only heats the upper half of the room, and this one and one of the previous ones felt REAL unclean but we gotta stay two days), my aunt is also in charge of paying for everyone's food with the money my mom gave and she gets a little upset when she thinks we're ordering too much food. I've been trying to stay out of it but it genuinely does suck (situation and the inn) and I understand my mom feeling disappointed, my aunt wanting to save, and I just want to pay for my own stuff but can only do so sparingly bc my mom doesn't want my aunt to know how much CNY/RMB I brought. Money culture is also super weird with my extended family and many other folks. Just can't wait to get back and not have to deal with family politics. Keeping my head low and just trying to find silver linings, hoping to see some fungi tomorrow...</p>
<p>My mom and I finally got to have a bit of time away from my aunt yesterday and walked into a tea shop where an older uncle had us try his tea selection.</p>

<p>While waiting for the bus my mom braided my hair</p>
<p>On the way down the lift we met a guy thought I was 17. My mom and aunt got upset that I didn't lie to him about my age.</p>
<p>Arguing with my mom in the taxi about how to get home from PDX. She wanted me to use Uber and I didn't want to, I wanted either my friend to drive me home and I'd buy dinner in exchange, or I'd take the MAX red line (45mins). She was like, "you just don't want to use Uber because of politics" and I was like "yes but no, they steal your data, plus other reasons" and she was so dismissive and I know it came from a good place but it was frustrating.</p>

<!-- D A Y : 12 --------------------------------------->

<h2>Saturday - March 22, 2025</h2>

<h3>Zhangjiajie</h3>
<p>Veggie buns, bought 2 more for CNY1.5 each with my uncle's red envelope money. My mom explained the math to me (1.5 * 2 is 3) which was so dumb and infantilizing because IT'S BASIC MATH and I KNOW, but it was still frustrating. She was apparently trying to hint and say that I shouldn't break up the bigger bills my uncle gave me without my aunt knowing, but at the cost of me looking like an absolute idiot. I'm bad at math but I'm not THAT bad smh.</p>
<p>Granules in the soybean milk is so pleasant but I had to finish fast at my mom's insistence to avoid taking on the gondola (called the Cableway Box).</p>

<h3>Tianmen Mountain</h3>

<h3>Glass Bridge</h3>

<h3>Tianmen Mountain</h3>
<p>Raining, crossed a bridge and tried to eat food on top of the Tianmen structure. There wasn't any food I could eat, and my aunt had tofu that was fried in oil that also had fried meat (and my mom straight up had meat).</p>
<p>Stabbing the stick in to prop up rocks is meant as a wish to the mountain god(s) for protection/good will</p>
<p>Big Cableway car for 20 ppl down (B-line)</p>
<p>Fox spirits are apparently a big hype point in China. So many stories about foxes that have reached some kind of enlightenment stage and turned into (very attractive) people and lured away people into the forest. The Tianmen foothills has an exhibition space dedicated to fox spirit performances, and they even have MASSIVE fox sculptures on top of the event space buildings.</p>
<p>Mountain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_giant_salamander">Wáwáyú</a> (娃娃鱼, translates to "kid/infant fish" due to their vocalizations resembling a crying child's) mascots. Wáwáyú are Chinese giant salamanders and is critically endangered but still eaten (and farmed) by locals as a delicacy.</p>
<p>Bus back, had to sit separately</p>
<p>Restaurant walked, next to hotel. Veeeeery uncomfortable with hanging dried meat at the entrance, but they are able to make things vegan (veggies cooked with vegetable oil). The hostess was the only one taking orders and she was saying everything is super tasty... The tea was supposed to be poured in these horribly flimsy small plastic cups (literally a gentle press made a big dent in them) with no ceramic teacups for some reason. Hāo câo bā bā. Kids playing by the building across from the restaurant at arcade games, flashing lights and I thought it was the backroom of the restaurant, and if it's the kids of the hostess. Wáwáyú ordered by another table and I fewlt really disturbed especially knowing that they're an endangered species. Ouckily my mom seemed to agree with me that eating them seemed cruel, though she seemed to favor the idea of farming them (which to me sounds even crueler).</p>

<h3>Zhangjiajie</h3>
<p>My mom and aunt were talking in the restroom and I overheard them, and my aunt was like "she (meaning me) doesn't want to get married right? She's just fooling around."</p>

<h2>Sunday - March 23, 2025</h2>

<h3>Zhangjiajie</h3>
<p>I tried a local Hunan specialty called Stinky Tofu (which surprisingly didn't stink but my mom said there's a faint aroma). It's very savory and flavorful and it's fermented with soybeans, tempeh, and baking soda (had a moment of panic bc the Taiwanese version uses milk and meats in their fermentation process). Also tried and finished the jackfruit, and THAT was really tasty! Like a fairly rubbery but sweet texture, has a slight aroma of the pink rope bubblegum if you've ever had it (or honestly big league chews) and yet still crunchy. There's a seed that can be popped out in the middle pretty easily!</p>
<p>9 hours train ride...</p>

<h3>Chengdu</h3>
<p>Uncle picked us up, literally could never drive in China. My uncle also keeps calling my by my brother's name. We went to the hotel he booked us and my mom went up first. I went up after her separately because my uncle didn't want the front staff to know we were all together, and then after both me and my mom were in the room he left for home. I could finally, FINALLY use the restroom and take a hot shower at 10:20PM. Gosh it feels so good to get clean!</p>
