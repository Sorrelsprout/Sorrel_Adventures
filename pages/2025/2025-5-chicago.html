<h3>Portland</h3>
<p>This morning woke up and felt a bit of preemptive homesickness. I didn't get to do the dishes and felt like I wanted to stay home to clean up more. My friend came by and picked me up bright and early at 5:45AM. She's super sweet and got me two <a href="https://www.doedonuts.com" target="_blank">Doe Donuts</a> (everything bagel donut, and a chocolate one with sprinkles), snack bars, and a book called Gideon the 9th which I unfortunately had to leave behind. My backpack was so full.</p>

<h3>PDX</h3>
<p>Ate one of the donuts (choco with sprinkles) and then went to concourse E and into the gate waiting area. Was worried that the donuts wouldn't be able to get through TSA but the one that was left was a-ok. After I got to the gat I saw my coworker asked for changes to some images on our site, which was extremely frustrating because they'd been on our site for a month at that point and he hadn't said anything before even though I'd sent in screen recordings of the site in action. But I updated the images and pushed the changes, and then boarded. I was the second-to-last person to board, part of group “C.” It was open seating so I snagged a middle seat towards the front of the plane (maybe the furthest front I've ever sat on any plane). One of the stewardesses was really funny and during the intro she was like “We love you but we don’t trust you so we’re checking your seatbelts,” and “if youre flying with children or people acting like children…” She also made a joke about pirates getting their hooks from second-hand stores.</p>

<h3>MDW</h3>
<p>Ventra Chicago 7-day pass</p>

<h3>Orange and Red Line Trains</h3>
<p>Headed to HI Chicago to check-in</p>

<h3>HI Chicago Hostel</h3>
<p>It felt so good to just sit and breathe for a bit. I checked in on work. I thought it was a hostel that i'd stayed in with my groupmates in college before when we had worked on the BLOOM SOFA CONNECT project, but it turns out it's a totally different one. Maybe I heard of HI Hostels from a friend...</p>

<h3>Chicago Diner</h3>
<p>Went to the Chicago Diner with a friend from my department from college. I got a truffle burger with mac and cheese.</p>
<p>Visited my friend's place.</p>

<h3>HI Chicago Hostel</h3>
<p>Fire alarm for some reason was going off at the hostel when my friend walked me back, and was super blaringly loud. Still don’t know what exactly happened but there were firefighters</p>
<p>Mana in bunk G was a vegetarian and she wa there when I re-entered. Just finished some kind of degree in San Diego, and she’s doing accounting. She’s from Bangalore. She wanted to talk a lot but I was so tired.</p>
<p>Loud ASF girls</p>
<p>Desire to explore - balance of "I'm too old for this shit" and "but yolo tho"</p>
