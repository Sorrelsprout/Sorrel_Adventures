<h2>Friday - May 6, 2025</h2>

<h3>Portland</h3>
<p>This morning woke up and felt a bit of preemptive homesickness. I didn't get to do the dishes and felt like I wanted to stay home to clean up more. My friend came by and picked me up bright and early at 5:45AM. She's super sweet and got me two <a href="https://www.doedonuts.com" target="_blank">Doe Donuts</a> (everything bagel donut, and a chocolate one with sprinkles), snack bars, a book called Gideon the 9th which I unfortunately had to leave behind, and a thoughtful safe travels note. My backpack was so full. It's not a long trip but I'm going to miss my friends.</p>

<h3>PDX</h3>
<p>Ate one of the donuts (choco with sprinkles) and then went to concourse E and into the gate waiting area. Was worried that the donuts wouldn't be able to get through TSA but the one that was left was a-ok. After I got to the gat I saw my coworker asked for changes to some images on our site, which was extremely frustrating because they'd been on our site for a month at that point and he hadn't said anything before even though I'd sent in screen recordings of the site in action. But I updated the images and pushed the changes, and then boarded. I was the second-to-last person to board, part of group “C.” It was open seating so I snagged a middle seat towards the front of the plane (maybe the furthest front I've ever sat on any plane). One of the stewardesses was really funny and during the intro she was like “We love you but we don’t trust you so we’re checking your seatbelts,” and “if youre flying with children or people acting like children…” She also made a joke about pirates getting their hooks from second-hand stores.</p>

<h3>MDW</h3>
<p>I bought a Ventra Chicago 7-day pass so I could use the public transport. Didn't understand fully at the time but that could access both the bus AND the rail which was amazing. The station smelled of bleach, and the trains were a little bit sketchy and smelled like unwashed bodies (as Brandon Sanderson would describe). I rode the Orange and Red Line trains to get to HI Chicago to check-in.</p>

<h3>HI Chicago Hostel</h3>
<p>It felt so good to just sit and breathe for a bit. I checked in on work. I thought it was a hostel that i'd stayed in with my groupmates in college before when we had worked on the BLOOM SOFA CONNECT project, but it turns out it's a totally different one. Maybe I heard of HI Hostels from a friend...</p>

<h3>Chicago Diner</h3>
<p>Went to the Chicago Diner with a friend from my department from college. I got a truffle burger with mac and cheese.</p>
<p>We walked around Wicker Park and got to the next station for the train to get back.</p>
<p>Visited my friend's place. His AC was broken</p>

<h3>HI Chicago Hostel</h3>
<p>Fire alarm for some reason was going off at the hostel when my friend walked me back, and was super blaringly loud. Still don’t know what exactly happened but there were firefighters</p>
<p>Mana in bunk G was a vegetarian and she wa there when I re-entered. Just finished some kind of degree in San Diego, and she’s doing accounting. She’s from Bangalore. She wanted to talk a lot but I was so tired.</p>
<p>Loud ASF girls</p>
<p>Desire to explore - balance of "I'm too old for this shit" and "but yolo tho"</p>

<h2>Saturday - May 7, 2025</h2>

<h3>HI Chicago Hostel</h3>
<p>Woke up and tried to be as quiet as possible exiting. Mana and the other two girls were sound asleep. Felt a bit annoyed, and a part of me wanted to be just as loud as the girls, to give them a salty taste of what it's like to wake others up while they're trying to sleep, but it wasn't worth it. Mana deserved rest, and also I should be the bigger person and let go with kindness.</p>

<h3><a href="https://fancyplantscatering.com" target="_blank">Fancy Plants Cafe</a></h3>
<p>My friend who used to live in Chicago recommended this spot, and it was decent! Got a breakfast sandwich with veggies, and a cherry amaretto iced coffee. I couldn't taste the cherry much but it was tasty.</p>

<h3>Waterfront walk</h3>
<p>Walking along the water, it was so toasty warm. I thought it would be best to put on sunscreen but I didn't have any with me, so I kept my windbreaker/sunshirt on which made it feel warmer but safer. I thought back to an ex-friend from Florida who got skin cancer, and wondered how they're doing. It's easier than expected to let folks slip away from a present mind when there's so many other people to interact with daily/weekly.</p>
<p>Looking out at Lake Michigan, it felt so serene. Calmer than the lapping of Pacific waves, and the sunlight twinkled on each crest. Existence there felt peaceful. Existence itself felt peaceful, which isn't a common thought for me. I felt humbled by the Pacific every time after seeing it, and LAke Michigan's waters were humbling too. Such a vast expance, crests forever moving, lapping, twinkling... This felt like one of thise moments, the ones where you remember as a looping video clip over and over again for the rest of your conscious life. Don't know why but this <a href="https://youtu.be/MxwIDL7pZDI?si=2PsYc_7Fdvcu1qh1&t=50" target="_blank">clip</a> from a semi-cringey movie I watched a very very long time ago kind of triggers that feeling. Maybe it's the fleeting moment of feelings, the human-ness of existing in a moment full of emotion. Do I feel more or less disembodied after reflecting on these moments?</p>
<p>I tried to see if there were any Atlas Obscura ejtries nearby and saw that there were Buddha heads. I almost didn't go see them, my feet felt sore already but I went anyways. I don't know if I'll ever be back. There were SO many joggers. Mosquito swarm by Belmont Rocks.</p>

<h3>Bus 151</h3>
<p>Passed by farmer's market</p>
<p>Green line to conservatory, some guy took off his shoes and I had to move cars.</p>

<h3>Garfield Conservatory</h3>
<p>The Fern Room was my <b>F A V O R I T E</b>!</p>

<h3>Chinatown</h3>
<p>Veggie House USA - charger, spicy tofu, dumplings</p>
<p>Chinatown square</p>
<p>Ping Tom Park - hardcore heavy music</p>
<p>Molly tea - jasmine orange oat with crystal agar boba.</p>

<h3>Red Line to the Godfrey Hotel</h3>
<p>Red line express on accident, Fullerton back. Thought I might be late or too tired, but I made it to the hotel and checked in. After going up to the room, opened my work computer to check for any requests. Dillydallied and used the bathroom, put on some bandaids and then set off again to get to Handlebar.</p>

<h3>Handlebar</h3>
<p>Met my coworker at <a href="https://www.handlebarchicago.com" target="_blank">Handlebar</a> in Wicker Park. He's the communication person between our little tech branch and the parent company. He looked basically similar to how he was online, but his eyes looked different. There was just something that felt different, online he seemed more approachable, more friendly. In person just felt strange, off somehow. Not that he wasn't generally friendly, and maybe it was his tiredness, maybe because he had drank, but his grey hair seemed more prominent and he seemed like he didn't really want to be there and yet was doing so out of obligation. Which I understand, and also was probably the case.</p>
<p>I felt a bit disappointed with Handlebar, had initially thought it was a fully vegan spot since my friend who recommended it is vegan. But it wasn't. My coworker asked for "real cheese" on his tacos when the waitress prompted him for his cheese preference. At least I got to have him try a bit of my mac and cheese, but maybe I shouldn't have shared it because it wasn't great and he didn't seem to like it. It feels bad, it wasn't really about the meal itself. It was that I was hinging my morals on this dish/restaurant to be a good representation of them, and that symbol had failed. Vegan food, which he was already making fun of at times, hadn't impressed him, there wasn't a way his eyes could be opened this day. "Real" cheese is apparently too good, nevermind the fact that dairy cows get forcibly inseminated for "real cheese" to be produced. How else if not for unweaned calfs does milk get produced? Fuck the living, breathing, and feeling livestock, oral sensory pleasure overrides everything.</p>
<p>My coworker called an uber that we shared back. The driver was bonkers though, speeding through traffic at crazy speeds and it was a real physically jerky experience. My coworker and I kept concernedly looking at each other throughout the trip, and then we finally arrived.</p>

<h3>Godfrey Hotel</h3>
<p>Getting back to my room felt SO good. I didn't even check in on my work computer because I was so exhausted. No more socializing. Just played some NYT games and then went to bed. I felt thankful that the next day I'd still have some time to explore. Walked 10+mi today (tracked on Strava).</p>

<h2>Sunday - May 8, 2025</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.goddessandthebaker.com" target="_blank">Goddess and the Baker</a></h3>
<p>This visit to Goddess and the Baker was... not great. I must have really glorified it in my mind, but maybe there's just been many changes since Summer 2018 when I visited with my uni Design team. I remember my industrial design friend (whom I texted a picture of the cafe to) and I going in, and I had ordered this $7+ crème brulée cheesecake and it was so tasty that I cried. I literally CRIED after eating it, it was THAT good. I had told my mom I'd take her there one day just for the cheesecake. But over the years, they've stopped offering it, and I also won't eat normal cheesecake anymore. In fact, none of the pastry/food menu items aside from drinks seemed to be vegan. I got a cherry pistachio latte to go. Was thinking about sitting and reminiscing but GOSH it was crowded. Maybe the shop was quite popular back then too, but a whole 7 years later maybe it got even more packed. They no longer had the little enamel pins as merch, and honestly, the drink itself was rather mediocre. The to-go lid also had an issue, their lids weren't sized properly to their drinks. I was going to walk to the waterfront and thought maybe I could forego a lid and save a bit of plastic, but it was just far too inconvenient and I went back to the counter and asked for some assistance. The staff member didn't seem to speak English very well and the cafe was also VERY crowded, so he didn't understand what I wanted at first. I suggested dumping the thing into a cup for hot beverages instead but was met with a blank stare. He ended up passing the issue to other staff members, and they gave me a new lid after manhandling and spilling the drink a bit. It felt so chaotic... I felt bad for the staff but also frustrated at the service, this was nothing like what I'd remembered and felt disappointing to support that business. But at least I tried it... goodbye, Goddess and the Baker.</p>

<p>Existing at the Chicago waterfront and found a patch of shade. Saw a biker sitting so I sat too. The biker looked like one of my friends back at home. There were younger-looking people taking prom photos on a little ledge that extended out into the lake a bit. They lookedl ike they were habing fun, and there were so many rose petals.</p>

<h3><a href="https://butterflyhousechicago.com" target="_blank">The Butterfly House</a> at Navy pier</h3>
<p>I wasn't originally going to go to Navy Pier, but saw that if I went to the Butterfly House then I could take the bus straight to Planta Queen, where I was going to eat lunch. So many butterflies! I asked about the native species and the most prominent one they mentioned was the <a href="https://fieldguides.fieldmuseum.org/sites/default/files/rapid-color-guides-pdfs/butterflyguide_new.pdf" target="_blank">Painted Lady</a> (page 7)</p>

<h3>Bus 29</h3>
<p>Wanted to see yet ano9ther atlas Obscura destination but there wasn't any time.</p>

<h3>Planta Queen</h3>
<p>My friend also recommended <a href="https://www.plantarestaurants.com/location/planta-chicago" target="_blank">Planta Queen</a>! It's a fully plant-based sushi spot and it's real swanky. I felt like I wasn't dressed for the space.</p>
<p>I got a Red Dragon Roll (carrot salmon, avocado, pickled watermelon, &ldquo;masago,&rdquo; spicy mayo), and an eggplant unagi with miso truffle and unagi sauce. That eggplant unagi. Was INCREDIBLE. I mean, that dragon roll was amazing, but ohhhh gosh the way the eggplant it just melted in my mouth, so creamy-smooth... it was unreal!! So tasty. It's the new crème brulée cheesecake, the best emotion-evoking memorable food!</p>

<h3>The MART</h3>
<p>NeoCon sales meeting, got to meet most of, if not all, the sales reps. Most of them were women, and there were about 3ish guys there? It was nice to see so much woman energy in a space, but also it seems like some of the guys were higher ups, and of course the big bosses were guys too. It was quite a long meeting, and after it adjourned, I stayed a little to see if I could help with anything, then walked back to the hotel. It was rainy along the way and I tried to breathe in and absorb some of the petrichor, but the curated-ness of the nature in the city kinda dimmed down the immersive pleasantness I was craving. I passed the building with the huge mushroom decor on the outside... and realized it was an old and abandoned Rainforest Cafe! My Industrial Design friend and I, SO long ago in college now, had wanted to go to that very Rainforest Cafe but somehow we didn't. And here it was, I walked past it once more.</p>

<h3>Godfrey Hotel</h3>
<p>When I got back to hotel, I was pretty wet. I saw the two Maine designers and also the sales manager in the lobby, and we discussed walking to dinner altogether.</p>
<p>Finally finished watching Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, which my friend and I had started watching but didn't finish. Played some NYT games and heard this HUGE roll of thunder. Tried to nap, but there was just too many things going on. I was exhausted but not sleepy enough.</p>
<p>Met Designer Coworkers from Maine at 6:15</p>

<h3>Siena Tavern</h3>
<p>Met up with the Maine designers in the lobby and we made our way over. I got to ask the more senior designer about what it was like in Kennebunk, and she talked briefly about how she came to do what she did.</p>
<p>Team dinner at <a href="https://www.sienatavern.com" target="_blank">Siena Tavern</a>. At the beginning. I asked for blackberry sparkling water while everyone else drank. I sat diagonally across from the very vocal California saleswoman and also the two owners of company. I got a bit of an upset stomach after course 3, which was a gigantic brussel sprout salad. I felt like I had to eat so much so fast since my coworkers had smaller portions and ebveryon e was supposed to be served at the same time. Then there was strawberry gelato and then 2 scoops of vegan chocolate gelato.</p>
<p>I did get to talk to the wife of one of the photographers at our company. She sat across from me and was the refreshing bit of luck I needed at that setting. She has no kids, loves birds, is a morning person, hikes (and backpacks occasionally with her husband), and also doesn't drink! So we were just sipping sparkling water and talking about backpacking. Her husband is starting his own wine company though, and she was disappointed with how much he was drinking. I sympathized quietly.</p>

<p>It's hard being in social situations where there's no easy "out" or autonomous way to dip without being socially unfriendly. I was also the only vegan. There were two pescatarian folks and two gluten free folks, but it was very uncomfortable being at a table where everyone else was eating meat and dairy.</p>

<p>Maine designers and the sales manager walking back</p>

<p>Lots of shit-talking and feeling uncomfortable because of that. It's a little more than jarring hearing folks talk about each other negatively behind their backs. It was draining and I tried my best to say nice things about someone even if I personally might not be friends with them after someone shit talked/complained about someone else. I wanted to be anywhere else, even extensively traveling, than being at that table with the CA saleswoman, the heads of the company, and my drunk and vegan-unfriendly coworker.</p>

<p>Walked 13+mi (tracked)</p>

<h2>Tuesday - May 10, 2025</h2>

<h3>Godfrey Hotel</h3>
<p>4:30 super tired, pack, kombucha</p>

<p>5:30AM train, switched cars because I couldn't stand the smell of these guys near me.</p>

<h3>MDW</h3>
<p>So nasty, the guy in front of me in TSA literally smelled like unwashed ass. I wondered how he got so far in life, if he had anyone who cared for him enough to tell him that wasn't normal to smell such a way. It seemed like he was with his family too, and also normally dressed.</p>

<p>Flight delay because of changing wheels</p>

<p>Hour nap</p>

<p>Rude flight attendant from SW said she “couldn't hear me say no ice” through my mask and I'd just wanted a can. The way she said it was super condescending and she repeated the mask part twice, was being all showy. Glasses, middle aged, bob, dark hair. The P100 mask I have is a super uninhibitive so I know she was just trying to be rude but I was too tired so I just didn't say “sorry” or “thank you.”</p>

<p>Listening to Gathering Moss and imagining different types of moss growing where they're best suited. They're particular about where they grow, specific about what it would take for them to sporulate(?) and although some are heartier than others they can grow/live in unideal circumstances, durability. The concept of durability. Humans are the same, it takes an ideal environment in order for them to thrive even if they can get by in times of unideal-ness.</p>
