<h2>Friday - May 6, 2025</h2>

<h3>Portland</h3>
<p>This morning woke up and felt a bit of preemptive homesickness. I didn't get to do the dishes and felt like I wanted to stay home to clean up more. My friend came by and picked me up bright and early at 5:45AM. She's super sweet and got me two <a href="https://www.doedonuts.com" target="_blank">Doe Donuts</a> (everything bagel donut, and a chocolate one with sprinkles), snack bars, and a book called Gideon the 9th which I unfortunately had to leave behind. My backpack was so full.</p>

<h3>PDX</h3>
<p>Ate one of the donuts (choco with sprinkles) and then went to concourse E and into the gate waiting area. Was worried that the donuts wouldn't be able to get through TSA but the one that was left was a-ok. After I got to the gat I saw my coworker asked for changes to some images on our site, which was extremely frustrating because they'd been on our site for a month at that point and he hadn't said anything before even though I'd sent in screen recordings of the site in action. But I updated the images and pushed the changes, and then boarded. I was the second-to-last person to board, part of group “C.” It was open seating so I snagged a middle seat towards the front of the plane (maybe the furthest front I've ever sat on any plane). One of the stewardesses was really funny and during the intro she was like “We love you but we don’t trust you so we’re checking your seatbelts,” and “if youre flying with children or people acting like children…” She also made a joke about pirates getting their hooks from second-hand stores.</p>

<h3>MDW</h3>
<p>Ventra Chicago 7-day pass</p>

<h3>Orange and Red Line Trains</h3>
<p>Headed to HI Chicago to check-in</p>

<h3>HI Chicago Hostel</h3>
<p>It felt so good to just sit and breathe for a bit. I checked in on work. I thought it was a hostel that i'd stayed in with my groupmates in college before when we had worked on the BLOOM SOFA CONNECT project, but it turns out it's a totally different one. Maybe I heard of HI Hostels from a friend...</p>

<h3>Chicago Diner</h3>
<p>Went to the Chicago Diner with a friend from my department from college. I got a truffle burger with mac and cheese.</p>
<p>Visited my friend's place.</p>

<h3>HI Chicago Hostel</h3>
<p>Fire alarm for some reason was going off at the hostel when my friend walked me back, and was super blaringly loud. Still don’t know what exactly happened but there were firefighters</p>
<p>Mana in bunk G was a vegetarian and she wa there when I re-entered. Just finished some kind of degree in San Diego, and she’s doing accounting. She’s from Bangalore. She wanted to talk a lot but I was so tired.</p>
<p>Loud ASF girls</p>
<p>Desire to explore - balance of "I'm too old for this shit" and "but yolo tho"</p>

<p>Being in social situation where there's no easy "out" or autonomous way to dip out without being socially unfriendly. I was also the only vegan. There were two pescatarian folks and two gluten free folks.</p>

<p>Maine designers and the sales manager walking back</p>

<p>Lots of shit-talking and feeling uncomfortable because of that. It's a little more than jarring hearing folks talk about each other negatively behind their backs. It was draining and I tried my best to say nice things about someone even if I personally might not be friends with them after someone shit talked/complained about someone else. I wanted to be anywhere else, even extensively traveling, than being at that table with Jenni, the two brothers, and my drunk vegan-unfriendly coworker.</p>

<p>Walked 13+mi (tracked)</p>

<h2>Tuesday - May 10, 2025</h2>

<h3>Godfrey Hotel</h3>
<p>4:30 super tired, pack, kombucha</p>

<p>5:30AM train, switched cars because I couldn't stand the smell of these guys near me.</p>

<h3>MDW</h3>
<p>So nasty, the guy in front of me in TSA literally smelled like unwashed ass.</p>

<p>Flight delay because of changing wheels</p>

<p>Hour nap</p>

<p>Rude flight attendant from SW said she “couldn't hear me say no ice” through my mask and I'd just wanted a can. The way she said it was super condescending and she repeated the mask part twice, was being all showy. Glasses, middle aged, bob, dark hair. The P100 mask I have is a super uninhibitive so I know she was just trying to be rude but I was too tired so I just didn't say “sorry” or “thank you.”</p>

<p>Listening to Gathering Moss and imagining different types of moss growing where they're best suited. They're particular about where they grow, specific about what it would take for them to sporulate(?) and although some are heartier than others they can grow/live in unideal circumstances, durability. The concept of durability. Humans are the same, it takes an ideal environment in order for them to thrive even if they can get by in times of unideal-ness</p>
