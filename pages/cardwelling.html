<h2>The Subie</h2>

<p>I got the 2022 Subaru Impreza for a deal in November 2019. With the chip shortage and manufacturing struggles from COVID, it was really a surprise when I found my dream car online for under $26K. The cozy hatchback, with a black fabric interior, is pretty awesome for stealth. It was a bit scary starting the mods (ahhh what if the car itself gets damaged? What if I break something?), but the modding cherry was definitely popped after the back seats were removed.</p>

<h2>The Bed Platform Mod</h2>
<h3>Version 1</h3>
<p>Too high</p>

<h3>Version 2</h3>
<p>Plain 1/2" plywood with border</p>

<h3>Version 3</h3>
<p>Version 3 of the bed platform was more of patching the platform up and actually wood-gluing the pieces together. The circular cardboard janked-together legs were replaced with stiff rectangular poplar. The two boards were re-screwed in place for added stability too. After sanding, staining with espresso-colored polyurethaine (for extra stealth), and buffing the painted platform to schooldesk-like consistency with wax, the platform didn't just feel like simply a platform anymore, it felt like <em>actual furniture</em>.</p>
