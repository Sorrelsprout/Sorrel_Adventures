<h3>Lassen Camping</h3>
<p>We arrived at night an parked in the central parking lot. It was a bit worrying because there wasn't a lot of instruction for where to pay, but we managed to get settled and found a spot not too far away from the visitor center. There was snow everywhere and the snowfall was like a wall twice our height next to the Subie! We went for a mini walk, testing out what the trail would be like. It was so cold, but once we started moving it was a bit more bearable. The stars though!<br>
    
<br>There were so many, it was stunning! I think Tolkan Campground was still #1 though, but oh MAN was it beautiful. We looked through the binoculars at the stars and took a short walk towards where we entered the parking lot.<br>

<br>Going to sleep car camping though, it was warm and very cozy, and I felt peaceful.</p>
