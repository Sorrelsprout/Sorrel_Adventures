<h3>Location</h3>
<p>We didn't bring camping blankets so used backup blankets that I kept in the Subie (one from CalHacks and the other a shawl thing from Uniqlo) to keep warm. It got colder in the night though so we used our jackets to keep warm, and Sam had to use his down jacket too.</p>

<h2>Saturday — Sep 2, 2023</h2>
<h3>Bear Hollow Campground</h3>
<p>I was a bit anxious about the broken glass (looked like it was from a car’s window) where we parked, but we had an undisturbed evening.</p>

<h3>Route 26 Espresso</h3>
<p>Coffee shop in a western-movie-looking town. Sam got a peanut butter latte which wasn’t as good as the caramel macchiato I got. I didn’t think it through now looking back, but I don’t think caramel is vegan…</p>

<h3>Kam Wah Chung & Co.</h3>
<p>We passed through a town called John Day and saw multiple signs for Kam Wah Chung (translates in Cantonese to Golden Flower of Prosperity), which turned out to be a Chinese historical town. Apparently in the 1880s John Day had the 3rd largest Chinatown in the US, because of a gold rush. Rebecca, a volunteer Oregon Parks tour guide, led us on the tour of the shop/apothecary/resthouse. She also mentioned that they had worked with the Oregon College of Oriental Science to study what was uncovered. Bruce (Rebecca’s husband) showed us some small smoke jars, tiny vials, dragon carvings, and metal gourd charm that local townspeople found, along with an opium pipe that was “borrowed” by a man and then returned to the museum collection by his family after the guy died.</p>

<h3>John Day, OR</h3>
<p>Vegan Chinese food and ate on a park picnic bench right behind Kam Wah Chung. It was tasty.</p>
<p>Ace hardware one black and one Latina from ca, Chester’s market for blankets, hunters</p>

<h3>Malheur National Forest</h3>
<p>We tried to see the Humongous Fungus, the Honey Mushroom (Armillaria ostoyae). It was super difficult to navigate to the location, but Sam guided me by signaling where to turn to avoid huge rocks, since the Subie's ground clearance isn't very high. We found a few spots that we could have camped in but all were pretty far from the central fruiting location. There were a few times where large rocks/sticks scraped the underside of the car and tree branches roughed up the sides, but no serious damage and the car has a few souvenier dents now.</p>
<p>It started to rain right as we found a suitable place to stay the night. We tried eating the rest of the vegan Chinese food but by then it had been a day and a half unrefrigerated and had a funky smell. We gave up after 2-3 bites and ate the three fortune cookies (one of which had no fortune inside). We also had Oreos and drank peach Waterloo seltzer instead.</p>
