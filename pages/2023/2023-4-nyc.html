<p>We went to NYC to support Sam's brother, who played flute at Carnegie Hall with his bandmates! It's also a celebration trip of sorts, since we just signed our first lease together in Portland.</p>

<h3>Flight</h3>

<h3>Bowery</h3>
<p>We stayed in a Citizen M hotel which had really excellent views, with a rooftop bar where you can see the full Skyline.</p>

<h3>Rockefeller Center</h3>
<p>We saw Manhattan from the viewpoint from one of Sam's office locations. It was crazy how tall the skyscrapers are, so much so that the cars on the gorund looked as small as ants. The windows were clear, and glass, and sturdy.</p>
<p>After Sam's brother and school group came down from the observatory, we reconvened with them to go to the FAO Schwarz toy and candy store.</p>
<p>We walked Sam's bro and the group to the hotel, with lots of fake flowers</p>

<h3>Walking back</h3>
<p>It was a bit scary walking back. We walked over a patch that smelled SUPER bad, and it could have been Chinatown's fish/meat market area.</p>
