<h3>Border crossing</h3>
<p>The border crossing was pretty quick! It felt a bit nervous when talking with the border agent but all we did was pass them our passports, they asked some questions, and then we passed right through.</p>
<p>We went to Tim Horton’s right after crossing, and Sam got a coffee and a donut.</p>

<h3>Lavender Land</h3>
<p>Smelled so good, and we took many photos. The best smelling kind in my opinion is the Melissa Lilac (Lavendula angustifolia)</p>

<h3>Buddhist Temple</h3>
<p>Super intricate and colorful buildings, with huge murals and golden statues.</p>
<p>For lunch we went to see what kind of food the temple had, and decided on their straw mushrooms fried with veggies and bamboo shoots. It was really tasty!</p>

<h3>AirBnB</h3>
<p>Our host Hamid was waiting for us when we arrived at his AirBnB. He was really welcoming, and had apparently traveled often before.</p>

<h3>Vancouver Punjabi market</h3>
<p>Really tasty desserts</p>

<h2>Tuesday — Jul 4th, 2023</h2>
<h3>Deep Cove</h3>
<p>Kayaking with the jellyfish</p>

<h3>Lynn Canyon Park</h3>
<p>Info center with super neat mushroom collection, with clay replications and a real massive conk.</p>

<h3>Stanley Park</h3>
<p>Vancouver waterfront totem poles and house posts</p>

<h3>Robson street</h3>
<p>We tried vegan dumplings at <a href="https://www.happycow.net/reviews/nine-dumplings-nine-dishes-vancouver-215189" target="_blank">Nine Dumplings Nine Dishes</a>. The building it was in looked like a small abandoned mall, and gave off liminal space vibes</p>
<p>We also went to <a href="https://www.gooddogsplantfoods.com" target="_blank">Good Dogs Plant Foods</a> which sold vegan hot dogs. They were spectacularly delicious, and the vibe was so nice. They had so many funky art on the walls, and outdoor seating too.</p>
<p>We went to the D'oro Gelato e Caffè and the gelato was really tasty. We ate it while we waited for the bus to bring us back to the AirBnB.</p>

<h2>Wednesday — Jul 5th, 2023</h2>
<h3>Furry creek</h3>
<p>Hiking, super warm</p>

<h3>Stawamus Chief </h3>
<p>Ssuper intense hike with gloriously tall trees and waterfalls, got to a rocky patch where we had to climb using a pre-installed rope at a 45-degree-ish incline up a rock face.</p>
<p>2nd peak. Sam wanted to go to the 3rd peak but I didn’t want to because I was so tired and we ran out of water.</p>
<p>Getting back down we didn’t go the exact same way we came from, and there were giant orangey-sequoias.</p>

<h3>2nd AirBnB in Whistler</h3>
<p>Walked around, looked like a ski camp similar to Truckee at Tahoe. Had ponds that were light blue-colored, due to the minerals in the water. Saw a moth in the grass with a broken wing and it was fluttering really fast. Felt bad for it but there was nothing we could do.</p>
<p>There was a concert going on in the main stage area right where our AirBnB balcony looks out at. The sound was very loud and we could hear it very much in the room.</p>

<h3>Whistler</h3>
<p>Mountain biking for the first time. We took a gondola up and it was difficult to get in. I felt embarrassed because I couldn’t get my bike in the lift and sit, and the attendant had to help me slide in and placed the bike. The bike pinned my helmet and I couldn’t move my face.</p>
<p>Felt like I was getting a concussion riding down.</p>

<h3>Green Lake</h3>
<p>Mountain biking but less intense</p>
<p>Lots of mosquitoes at Green Lake</p>
<p>John the dog, and his big white floorer buddy. I really wasn't sure where we were going, just wanted to get back as soon as possible. Sam had the map.</p>
<p>Going back was rough, less intense than on the first mountain but more intense because there were lots of turns and rocks.</p>

<h3>Whistler</h3>
<p>Tried to get Indian food but it was closed.</p>
<p>There was another concert/event going on.</p>

<h2>Friday — Jul 7th, 2023</h2>
<h3>Blackcomb Mountain</h3>
<p>Hiking and took the gondola. The scenery was beautiful and there were so many wildflowers. Particularly memorable was an orange mountain dandelion (Agoseris sp.), along with wispy truffula-tree-looking plants. We were so high up that we could see snow too.</p>
<p>Greenish-blue lake at top.</p>
<p>Mosquito bite was intensely itchy, and it was making my leg swell up. I had a pus bubble form and tried my best not to touch it. I had to limp to walk back and the skin around the bite was stretching so much that my leg was sore. I kept putting Tiger Balm on it.</p>

<h3>First Nations Heritage Center</h3>
<p>We wanted to check out the center, but they had a private event going on. As we exited, there was a man outside carving a house post. Samarth took a lot of interest and started talking to him, which was how we met <a href="https://www.xwalacktun.ca" target="_blank">Xwalacktun</a></p>

<h3>Hospital</h3>
<p>We went to the hospital right around where our AirBnB is, and the front desk staff actually took a brief peek at my leg. They suggested I head back to the states because it would be $12K if I even want to be seen.</p>

<h3>AirBnB</h3>
<p>There was another concert going on. I wasn’t too interested and just wanted my bite to heal.</p>

<h2>Saturday — Jul 8th, 2023</h2>
<h3>Washington</h3>
<p>My leg was so bad that the pus bubble swelled to the diameter of a quarter. We quickly packed and Sam drove us back to Washington where I could be seen by a Zoomcare doctor. He said it wasn’t sepsis so that’s good, and that it should go down, and that I should take Zyrtec/allergy meds to basically wait it out.</p>
<p>Sam drove us back 8 hours, since it was best I didn’t drive.</p>
