<h3>Initial Yosemite Exploring</h3>
<p>I went to Von's, which turned out to have the same branding (and was basically the same) as Safeway, and picked up three boxes of pasta, a jar of alfredo sauce, 2 boxes of veggie stock, a box of crimini mushrooms, and some veggie skewers.</p>
<p>Today was check-out-Yosemite day! I drove into the park, paid for a pass, and went to see the Tunnel Viewpoint. Along the way I stopped at an in-park store near Wawona, and picked up some taffy candies and a very small container of garlic powder. It was a long drive and I was itching to fit a hike in, so I parked and walked along Wawona rd... but there were so many mosquitoes! I got bit right on my Adam's apple, and didn't see any mushrooms, but saw some vibrant lupine wildflowers. The Tunnel Viewpoint was really gorgeous, and the tunnel itself was really lengthy too (4,233ft). Visible from the viewpoint were El Capitan, Halfdome, and Bridal Veil Falls. I helped some folks take their pictures, then returned to the AirBnB.</p>
<h3>White Feather Suite</h3>
<p>Tried the AirBnB hot tub, which was small and chlorinated and nice, and watched as the sun set and the stars all came out. There were turkeys gobbling somewhere off in the distance, and the crickets were chirping. The night was calm and beautiful.</p>

<h3>White Feather Suite</h3>
<p>This morning, made penne in alfredo sauce and it almost burned, but turned into a nice crispy sheet all melded together at the bottom of the pot. The meeting in the morning got cancelled and I felt relieved even though I didn't have to do anything.</p>
<p>At our 3:00PM Standup, my coworkers talked about travel and meditation. One of them was talking about Vipassana meditation, and how he went to a place in Gilroy, CA where he completed a meditation retreat. He said he sat in a dark room for at one point 14 hours, for 10 days, and worked through a lot of physical and mental trauma and painpoints, and he said it was the most helpful thing he's ever done. I think I might try it one day, and each day try to come up with things to work through/on. That coworker always has the most fascinating experiences, and I just feel really inspired to self-improve and travel like he's done.</p>
<h3>Mariposa Grove</h3>
<p>After work, I drove to through Oakhurst to Yosemite and along the way saw a billboard for Reimer's Candy Shop and it had a huge image of an icecream on it, so on impulse stopped at the shop. The candy shop was a very quaint cottage-like building and looked so grandma-valentine-cottagecore. Immediately after entering the shop, everything smelled so strongly of sugar! The lady at the counter acted and looked vaguely like my 11th grade English teacher, and seemed very enthusiastic and welcoming. She gave samples of Banana Nut and English Toffee (which tasted vaguely licorice-y). I left with two scoops of the banana nut, which was really nice in the heat.</p>
<p>After icecream, I stopped at the entrance of South Yosemite and hiked from the Mariposa Visitor Center to the trailhead for the Grove of Giant Sequoias. The loop for the Giant Sequoias was closed, so I ended up hiking the Grizzly Loop instead, which was shorter than expected. The giant sequoias in the area are <em>seriously</em> girthy, and the Grizzly Giant is so magnificent. I also walked past the Bachelor and Three Sisters, and the Tunnel Tree, where I helped a senior couple take their photo, and they helped me take one too.</p>
<p>On the way back to the Mariposa center, I passed by this white round thing emerging from the ground at the foot of a tree, and my heart skipped a beat. It turned out to be a puffball mushroom, seemingly a Calvatia sculpta whose spines hadn't yet elongated, the size of my fist! Originally I'd only wanted to cut it in half and analyze/ID it, but after hearing hikers behind me, I panicked and brought it along. This was the first time I'd (inadvertently) foraged a mushroom. I wrapped it in my butterfly hat, and after getting back to the AirBnB, analyzed it using iNaturalist and ShroomID.</p>
<p>Near the end of the trail, a deer emerged from the left through some trees, and got really close up. It was seemingly unafraid, possibly because previous hikers gave it food. But that wasn't even the only deer, because there was another one, also unafraid, just eating something off the side of the trail! I let the two hikers that were a distance behind me to pass by, so they could get a better view of the deer, and saw a third hiker. The third hiker and I had a similar walking pace, and we started talking. Her name is Ryan, and she said she was staying the week and headed to a festival just outside of Yosemite on the weekend. She had short short hair and this absolutely radiating smile, as if she was radiating energy. She said she was originally from New Mexico, but after the festival was driving to Flagstaff, AZ. We then hit the entrance and parted ways.</p>

<h2>Friday — May 20th, 2022</h2>
<h3>White Feather Suite</h3>
<p>Woke up at 6:00AM today, did the rest of the dishes, packed up, and cleaned a bit. I took the day off today even though I might have been behind on my work numbers. But good riddance, if I'm going to be the lowest paid designer, then why should I try so hard, right? So I headed off to Yosemtite Valley and the Upper Yosemite Falls Trailhead, and parked the Subie in the public lot across from Camp 4. The climb up was basically granite steps winding all the way up. It started off and remained an intense hike, but everyone I passed was friendly and encouraging, and we were all cheering each other on. Since we all knew how intense the hike was, there just felt to be a level of camaraderie between folks that were willing and wanting to spend a random Friday trekking nearly 3,000 ft uphill. I felt in my element. These were the other crazies that appreciated the journey just as much, if not moreso, than I.</p>
<p>There was this one couple that I passed and was overtaken by a couple of times. We helped each other take pictures in front of the falls, and then they passed me for the last time. I saw so many senior folks trooping along, and young kids who hiked without complaint, which was super impressive. At last I'd reached the metal sign (which was a really relieving sight) and then Overlook Point. A pair of two guys waiting on their friends was going to go to Eagle Peak, but after talking with them they decided they wanted to go to Overlook Point as well. I went on ahead and walked behind this other solo traveler, and we ended up at the viewpoint at the same time. He was really freaked out right at the edge of the viewpoint, and for good reason. It was tantilizingly high and a viewer can see <em>E V E R Y T H I N G</em> in the valley, and the falls were right next to it. We helped each other take photos, and he asked if there was a way back down through the North Dome Trail, but I didn't know. We parted ways, and I rested up and finished off the dehydrated apple-banana-strawberry chips I'd made two weeks ago.</p>
<h3>Upper Yosemite Falls Trail.</h3>
<p>After "lunch" I thought, since I'd made it this far, it's best to keep going right? My legs were so sore though, and I remembered when Sam was talking about the dangers of summit fever yesterday. I wondered if continuing would be overdoing it, but pushed on to Yosemite Point regardless. On the way up, two senior ladies passed by and they were just talking and walking and doing their thing! Seeing them was really motivating. I want to be like them one day, old and wrinkly, but still with that hiking energy. Two guys with hiking poles also passed by, and they were really excited, and told me that the view was so worth it. So I pushed on, and it really, really was. Yosemite Point was <em>amazing</em>. Halfdome in all its glory. The valley. The falls on the right. The sun blazing and the wind, an exhilirating gust. It was spectacular, and <em>way</em> scarier than Overlook Point, and my hands shook whenn I approcached the guardrail. I asked some folks if they wanted their pictures taken together, and they helped me take mine as well.</p>
<p>On the way back down, I had no idea where the trail back was, and I encountered this family of three who was also confused. There was a mom, a daughter, and a son, and we started taking a VERY jank way back down, through shrubs and the granite at a near 30-degree angle underneath our feet, jutting towards a cliff. I was going to split off and see if there was another way, but I also didn't want to leave the family alone in case something bad happened. I talked with the mom and daughter (the son seemed angsty and like he just wanted to be left alone), and the mom reminded me of Sam's mom. She said they were staying for a week and they entered the park at 6AM, and that they were staying in a nearby hotel. We ended up back on the trail where the river becomes the falls, and bypassed the wooded area where the two hiking pole guys were. We split off and I went to the river to dip my feet in and rest my legs. The water was so icy! After about 20 seconds I had to pull my feet out because it was freezing.</p>
<h3>Yosemite Point and the Way Down</h3>
<p>On the way down, I ended up behind this cluster of two groups of hikers, and we merged and became one bigger group of 7 people. A group of 3 Jehovia's Witnesses — a younger guy with toe-shoes who kept sliding in the sand, a two-week retired fire marshall, and a redheaded Austrian guy). The other group was of 3 friends — a French girl named Amy who does cross country but moved to SF to work as a nurse at UCSF, her boyfriend Will who was born and raised in SF, and Amy's friend Agatha who flew in from France a couple days ago).</p>
<p>Toe-shoe guy, the retired fire marshall, and Amy were the ones I talked to the most. Toe-shoe guy was really struggling with the sandy granite steps. He said he and the fire marshall met through being Jehovia's Witnesses, and that they were unlikely friends. He is young, black, and reserved, and the fire marshall is older, white, and very extraverted. The fire marshall had just retired two weeks ago, and was really excited about exploring now that he has more time. We talked a bit about work and the trails, and he suggested I visit Lee Vining near Mono Lake, which was the same place that Cal the UPS guy who I met at Mt. Diablo last year <em>really</em> liked. He said that yesterday he and toe-shoe guy had hiked the Mist Trail. And finally I talked to Amy. She used to pick blackberries in Bordeaux, France, with her family, and she said her grandparents foraged mushrooms. We talked a lot about food in SF and she recommended a few French places and an ice cream spot.</p>
<p>On the way down we saw a double rainbow created by the falls. According to will, apparently there are 60 of those winding stone steps that we hiked up and down, but according to Google there are over 135 switchbacks. Tomorrow is my brother's birthday and I stopped in Yosemite Village to pick up a nice hoodie-tee set and sticker.</p>
<h3>Lower Pines Campground</h3>
<p>I hiked to and into Happy Isles and back, which was about 2mi. There were little informational sign panels along the trail, but the community center had closed. One of the informational posts was for the rock fall. I thought about the rock fall, how a giant slab of granite could just... crack and fall, and roll and kill folks. What if it was intenss enough that it'd land on the Subie? While I was sleeping in it? Just poof, squashed like a bug. And the trees wouldn't care, and neither would the setting sun. So small. We're all so tiny with stupid little human problems, not knowing or grasping the magnificence of nature, its biodiversity, nor other species. I passed by a plaque honoring Steven Tyng Mather, who helped found and direct the National Parks Service. I wondered if people ever looked at him and judged him for trying to help conserve these precious environments. If people made him doubt himself while he was in the thick of it all.</p>
<p>Today was a pretty crazy day. 11+ miles of hiking. 7 miles, then 2 extra miles for Yosemite Point there and back, and also Happy Isles-- the most impressive workout since Tolkan last year. I didn't have signal at the campground though, and started missing Sam way extra for some reason. It was odd, I'd had a good day and it was a lovely campsite too, but it felt like a part of me was missing, and it hit hard. I slept early.</p>

<h3>Groveland</h3>
<p>It was so nice waking up in the valley, looking up through the trees at the magnificence of the granite walls and the sheer hight of the mountains. I wanted to hike the Mist Trail since the fire marshall was talking about it yesterday, but thought it best to be on my way. So got packed around 8AM, then left Lower Pines Campground to set off to Groveland, CA. The drive was along HWY 120 and I passed through 3 shorter tunnels along the way. I was craving pizza so when I finally got signal, I navigated to Two Guys Pizza Pie. when I arrived, the place hadn't opened yet, so I went to check out a local coffee shop called Mountain Sage. They had a little garden and sold garden tools, seating for working indoors and outdoors, and a little shop that sold shirts and soaps and trinkets. I asked the lady at the counter if she made the soaps herself, but she said that her friend, a local artist, did. It's really nice that the shop partners with locals for that. I also asked for reccomendations on things to do in Groveland but she only mentioned Rainbow Pools, which is apparently a swimming hole. I got a lavender latte (which for some reason tastes <em>nothing</em> like lavender but was still tasty), and a kale smoothie, then went for a brief stroll through the garden and filled up gas. Good thing too, because the drive to Cherry Valley was over an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Along the way, there was a sign for a festival called the Sum of Us, and I wondered if that was the festival that Ryan (lady from Wednesday) was going to.</p>
<h3>Cherry Valley Campground</h3>
<p>I thought I'd pass through Oakhurst again, but the maps routed a different way out of the park. Didn't grasp that with first-come-first-serve campgrounds, that people could stay multiple days, and I was lucky enough to snag a third-to-last available campsite. The first time around, the only open spot I could see was a place right next to the vault restrooms (four-word horror story: vault toilet Poseidon's kiss), and I wasn't digging it, so looped back around and talked with the campground host Andy. He was very kind and suggested I take another loop since the route I took had the campsites with the best views, but said that if I couldn't find one, he thought #20 was open and was a more secluded spot in the middle of the campground. I made the loop and realized I'd overlooked #35. Honestly #20 would probably have been a better choice (#35 was at an angle and was parallel parking), but I just wanted to get settled.</p>
<p>The folks in my neighboring campsite were talking about how abundant the trout is in Cherry Lake. One guy Dan was talking about how tasty the trout is to the other guy Ryan (another different, male Ryan), and how he got his dog Ragnar a doggy lifejacket. I hadn't meant to eavesdrop, but Dan's voice was honestly so loud and it kind of seemed like he wanted the entire campsite to hear. Dan complained loudly about his ex-wife, and the way he hocked up flegm showed that he truly did not give a fuck. He seemed like he was talking to Ryan way more than Ryan wanted, but since Dan offered Ryan a place in his boat and to show him a good fishing spot, I think Ryan wanted to keep the conversation flowing. I could also hear a person further in the campground whistling the All-Star Shrek song.</p>
<p>The bugs were pretty wild there. Ants kept crawling on my leg. They were all big and yellow-and-black striped. I was looking out the rear window of the Subie and just noticed more and more mosquitoes appear. First there were about 3 and then there were 8, then there were like 20. As soon as I sat up to adjust the sheets and laid back down, they vanished. Then reappeared again after a few seconds. Seems like those bloodthirsty little fuckers were trying to get some nourishment through the glass.</p>
<p>I feel like I miss the Saratoga-Santa Cruz mountains more and more because of the redwoods, despote how massive and impressie the giant sequoias are.</p>
