<h3>On the Road</h3>
<p>Huge bump and sketchy riverside RVs, dispersed camping</p>
<p>Sam's phone's charging port wasn't working properly and it took a while to reshape a bent metal piece on the inside. I used the tweezers on my pocket knife but accidentally dropped them between the seats... they're lost forever now. Afterwards it was a lot easier to charge the phone, but my hands started shaking from hunger. Sam suggested we go to Dunkin Donuts, and we got a box of 12! There were a LOT of donuts and we engulfed about half. We also got some pumpkin coffees and hit the road again.</p>

<h2>Sunday — Sep 11th, 2022</h2>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>After packing up we walked along the road until we saw an RV out in the distance, then decided to head back to the Subie, to start the long journey back to the bay. People passed by on trucks and it seemed like they lived in the area, and we also met a lady walking a very cute black labrador puppy named Riley. The puppy was a year old and was very excited by people.</p>
