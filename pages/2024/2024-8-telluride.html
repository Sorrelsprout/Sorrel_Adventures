<h2>Friday - Aug 9, 2024</h2>
<h3>Portland</h3>
<p>I watered all my plants and did some final cleanup. I'm worried about my plants but know they're in safe hands. Closed all the windows and also did a final sweep of things, and then set off! Yesterday we watched Rings of Power, that Lord of the Rings show and stayed up a bit later.</p>

<h3>Hood River, OR</h3>
<p>Went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goldengoodshr" target="_blank">Golden Goods Sandwich and Bake Shop</a> and got a matcha latte and a raspberry danish. I was originally going to go to a different cafe but my parking spot was RIGHT in front of GG, and when I looked up the labeling on the window said "plant-based" and I felt like that was probably a better option to support anyways. I didn't eat the danish immediately but saved it for lunch.</p>
<p>After driving some though, I got sleepy because </p>

<h3>Pendleton, OR</h3>
<p>Avocado Fresh Rolls at <a href="https://www.thaicrystalpendleton.com" target="_blank">Thai Crystal</a>. I ordered in-store but got it to-go. The cashier seemed a bit frosty, but the rolls were very tasty!</p>

<h3>Tamástslikt Cultural Center, OR</h3>
<p>I first saw this place when looking at Atlas Obscura at places to stop by and see. It reminded me of the other native center around John Day.</p>
<p>It was 105°F outside! After parking I entered the cultural center. I went to the museum exhibition area and talked briefly with the desk attendant. Went through the exhibit.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plateau Indians</li>
    <li>Foraging and harvesting</li>
    <li>Beadwork, surprisingly the beads were mostly from trading.</li>
    <li>Coyote Firepit Stories - Coyote tossing his eyes into the sky. Resembles <a href="https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~rfrey/EJEyeJuggler.htm" target="_blank">this story</a>, though the tale doesn't match with the one in the website. In the firepit version, Coyote threw his eyes into the sky, and there was no old man. Eagle was jealous of Coyote's eyes and caught the eyes in his talons and flew off with them. Coyote then replaces his eyes with yellow buttercup flowers. Later in the firepit version, Coyote also encounters a monster that swallows everything (plants, salmon, other animals, etc.) into its stomach but I didn't catch the monster's name. Coyote didn't get swallowed fro some reason and he finds and provokes the monster into swallowing him. Eagle also gets swallowed but we don't hear about if Coyote got his eyes back from Eagle or not... Coyote then somehow uses his powers to release all the plants, salmon, and other animals from the stomach, and then he also escapes and the tale ends. None of that was in the eye-juggling story, but I found something similar to that tale on <a href="https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/nepe/legend_times.html" target="_blank">this website</a> (which also doesn't name the monster).</li>
    <li>Horse section, the Cayuse first saw enemy Shoshone warriors riding them and exchanged all their weapons for a mare and a steed.</li>
    <li>Story hut, another coyote tale about him trying to get to a group of women but the women evading him, and he caused the creation of a set of waterfalls as he floated down the river past them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Textile dyes from the Hudson Bay Trading Company</p>

<h3>Entering Idaho</h3>
<p>There were a whole bunch of apples on this one section of freeway, some trucker must have dropped a bunch. I also saw quite a bit of roadkill. There was a fox or coyote of some kind, and something else orangeish which was sad.</p>

<h3>Eagle, ID</h3>
<p>The AirBnB is so cute! It's in Eagle, ID, right next to Boise. I checked in and explored the house for a bit. The host said no one else booked a room, so I get the full house to myself! The host also prepared disposable toothbrushes, which was a really nice touch!</p>
<p>Got a pad thai from <a href="https://www.boisethainoodlehouse.com" target="_blank">Boise Thai Noodle House</a> (it is a very thai-food filled day) and I ate part of it in the backyard area. Then went inside because there were bugs outside and I was afraid they might have been mosquitoes.</p>
