<h2>Friday - Aug 9, 2024</h2>
<h3>Portland</h3>
<p>I watered all my plants and did some final cleanup. I'm worried about my plants but know they're in safe hands. Closed all the windows and also did a final sweep of things, and then set off! Yesterday I stayed up late but we finished watching Rings of Power, the first season of the Lord of the Rings show. I also got my period yesterday and this morning had to take Tylenol to ease the pain. It feels like the first couple days are gonna be really rough...</p>

<h3>Hood River, OR</h3>
<p>Went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goldengoodshr" target="_blank">Golden Goods Sandwich and Bake Shop</a> and got a matcha latte and a raspberry danish. I was originally going to go to a different cafe but my parking spot was RIGHT in front of GG, and when I looked up the labeling on the window said "plant-based" and I felt like that was probably a better option to support anyways. I didn't eat the danish immediately but saved it for lunch.</p>
<p>After driving some though, I got sleepy even after matcha. I had to pull into a park along the route to nap for like 40m.</p>

<h3>Pendleton, OR</h3>
<p>Avocado Fresh Rolls at <a href="https://www.thaicrystalpendleton.com" target="_blank">Thai Crystal</a>. I ordered in-store but got it to-go. The cashier seemed a bit frosty, but the rolls were very tasty!</p>

<h3>Tamástslikt Cultural Center, OR</h3>
<p>I first saw this place when looking at Atlas Obscura at places to stop by and see. It reminded me of the other native center around John Day.</p>
<p>It was 105°F outside! After parking I entered the cultural center. I went to the museum exhibition area and talked briefly with the desk attendant. Went through the exhibit.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plateau Indians</li>
    <li>Foraging and harvesting</li>
    <li>Beadwork, surprisingly the beads were mostly from trading.</li>
    <li>Coyote Firepit Stories - Coyote tossing his eyes into the sky. Resembles <a href="https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~rfrey/EJEyeJuggler.htm" target="_blank">this story</a>, though the tale doesn't match with the one in the website. In the firepit version, Coyote threw his eyes into the sky, and there was no old man. Eagle was jealous of Coyote's eyes and caught the eyes in his talons and flew off with them. Coyote then replaces his eyes with yellow buttercup flowers. Later in the firepit version, Coyote also encounters a monster that swallows everything (plants, salmon, other animals, etc.) into its stomach but I didn't catch the monster's name. Coyote didn't get swallowed fro some reason and he finds and provokes the monster into swallowing him. Eagle also gets swallowed but we don't hear about if Coyote got his eyes back from Eagle or not... Coyote then somehow uses his powers to release all the plants, salmon, and other animals from the stomach, and then he also escapes and the tale ends. None of that was in the eye-juggling story, but I found something similar to that tale on <a href="https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/nepe/legend_times.html" target="_blank">this website</a> (which also doesn't name the monster).</li>
    <li>Horse section, the Cayuse first saw enemy Shoshone warriors riding them and exchanged all their weapons for a mare and a steed.</li>
    <li>Story hut, another coyote tale about him trying to get to a group of women but the women evading him, and he caused the creation of a set of waterfalls as he floated down the river past them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Textile dyes from the Hudson Bay Trading Company</p>

<h3>Entering Idaho</h3>
<p>There were a whole bunch of apples on this one section of freeway, some trucker must have dropped a bunch. I also saw quite a bit of roadkill. There was a fox or coyote of some kind, and something else orangeish which was sad.</p>
<p>I also was listening to more of <a href="#/" target="_blank">Braiding Sweetgrass</a> by Robin Wall-Kimmerer. One of the topics she talked about in that section was of lichen, how they are a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae. That the relationship wouldn't form if one or both specimens had adequate nutrients, but in times of high stress they will combine to survive. The algae provides photosynthetic benefits for energy production and the fungus... does something. I have to read more about it because I didn't catch that part.</p>

<h3>Eagle, ID</h3>
<p>The AirBnB is so cute! It's in Eagle, ID, right next to Boise. I checked in and explored the house for a bit. The host said no one else booked a room, so I get the full house to myself! The host also prepared disposable toothbrushes, which was a really nice touch! The neightborhood also felt really safe. I would have taken a night walk if I wasn't so tired. The sunset made me think of <a href="#/" target="_blank">Threads</a> by Blankts.</p>
<p>Got a pad thai from <a href="https://www.boisethainoodlehouse.com" target="_blank">Boise Thai Noodle House</a> (it is a very thai-food filled day) and I ate part of it in the backyard area. Then went inside because there were bugs outside and I was afraid they might have been mosquitoes.</p>

<!-- D A Y : 2 ---------------------------------------->
<h2>Saturday - Aug 10, 2024</h2>
<h3>Boise, ID</h3>
<p><a href="#/" target="_blank">Alchemist Coffee</a>. Recommended by my friend Steph, who had gone to Boise with her husband a couple months ago. Super witchy vibes, and the area kind of looked like the condo neighborhood around Carina's Bakery in Beaverton.</p>
<p>Farmer's Market. At half of the pad thai leftovers.</p>
<p>Saw a hair salon called "Pigment" that had a really nice=looking typeface for its logo. Driving through Idaho I thought about my photographer coworker who stayed in Meridian, ID for a bit with his 6 kids. I suppose all the big big houses makes sense to have large families in.</p>

<h3>Shoshone Falls in Twin Falls, ID</h3>
<p>Coyote legend about the falls. Coyote was gathering salmon and to carry them home he lined a woven masket he made with pitch. But while carrying it, the salmon got spilled and the water just kept growing and growing so Coyote tried to make dams.</p>
<p>The falls were super stunning, and there was even a little rainbow that appeared in the midst of the mist. I saw a few kayakers in the Snake River, and thought, "man it would be SO nice to kayak there" but I have no time. But oh, to kayak in such a beautiful place surrounded by rock cliffs on either side, drifting on the water...</p>
<p>Chinese presemce at Snake River's gold rush time, many parallels with John Day.</p>
<p>Closed viewpoint. Couple from Utah who has family in ID. Also saw some kind of a little brown mushroom.</p>
<p>While driving, got caught up marinating on the Coyote stories, and I also started to think about where other stories came from. Like other myths or ghost stories, and that led to thinking about where the concept of corporeal beings who retain their visages comes from. Like if someone died, why would they be wearing thte clothes they died in, as depicted in so much media? That led to thinking about maybe ghosts just being manifestations of guilt by the living, since the living imposes the visual onto the concept of a "ghost."</p>
<p>The first rest stop that I stopped at, I only went to finish the pad thai, toss some garbage, and use the restroom. I was going to nap but it was just WAY too hot. The second rest stop I napped at for 10 minutes only, because it was still so hot, but was too tired not to rest.</p>

<h3>Ogden, UT</h3>
<p>Grabbed a green tea frapuccino-thing (though it wasn't called that) at <a href="#/" target="_blank">Mercantile on 25th</a>. Their bathrooms were remotely-unlockable by the staff.</p>

<h3>Antelope Island, UT</h3>
<p>SUPER hot outside. I ate a bunch more dried fruit that I had prepped but was getting proper hungry. Got VERY mediocre fries at the Bison Grill, which was like an in-park restaurant? I should have expected not-great food. The potato-y ness tasted like water, with minimal seasoning. There's so much salt in the great Salt Lake, why couldn't they rep their fries a little better and add proper salt??</p>
<p>Reminded me of the baylands in CA. It brought back memories of both peace and numbness. I listened to <a href="#/" target="_blank">Cruise</a> by Attom and it felt like the song fit with the serene and colorful waters with the soft separation between water and sky.</p>

<h3>Salt Lake City, UT</h3>
<p>The freeways around SLC are actually frickin insane. They reminded me of intense Bay Area freeways, with 6 lanes and very aggressive drivers. All the stress came rushing back.</p>
<p>Tried to go to the bathroom and though the SLC Public Library (which was also mentioned as a place of interest on <a href="#/" target="_blank">Atlas Obscura</a>. I didn't intend to go but using the restroom there seemed like a good idea). I accidentally parked in front of I think some kind of government building, and I circled it wondering why everything was locked. Ended up asking a guy dressed as a cowboy with a red collared shirt and legit-looking cowboy hat and boots, and he said the building across the street was actually the library. But right after I entered the real library the bathrooms all got closed, so I decided to leave.</p>
<p>The "Up" house was also on Atlas Obscura and I went to check it out. It was only a couple minutes that I spent there, and they had a rule saying to keep visits to under 3 mins for privacy. They had disney-themed things in the yard with mickey ears, and a really nice-looking garden.</p>
<p>Listened to more Braiding Sweetgrass. A topic that Wall-Kimmerer mentioned was the legend of the Wendigo. She talked about the concept of a "Wendigo Economy". She also talked about Chaga, how it grows on birch, and how it's used both for medicinal purposes as well as a fire-starter since it burns so consistently and holds heat so well. I actually ended up finishing the book! It was also right after exiting SLC proper, and the traffic got less intense too.</p>
<p>After such a long time listening to the book (and engrossing the last bits of the book were), after the narration concluded I just felt... empty. Like peaceful empty, like I didn't know who I was or where I am or what I'm doing. Like a bubble just popped, or like waking from a deep sleep, I had to actively remember who I was because it was like the concept of "me" just didn't exist. It happens moreso when I'm alone I think, thoughts get so intense that feeling like a person just gets lost sometimes. And then I started craving a lemon jelly danish.</p>
<p>Got Pizza at <a href="#/" target="_blank">___</a> and could FINALLY use the restroom. I ate two slices while listening to <a href="#/" target="_blank">Breathe Deeper</a> by Tame Impala, <a href="#/" target="_blank">Marco Polo</a> by China Line, and <a href="#/" target="_blank">The Breach</a> by Dustin Tebbutt, all of which were from Spotify's algorithm. Just vibed to music and thought, this moment will never happen again. Somehow all three songs really just... fit with the scenery, the setting sun's golden rays onto the chaparraled mountains, the aroma of pizza and the moderate temperature of the AC'd Subie.</p>

<h3>Ponderosa-Uinta Campground</h3>
<p>SUPER long stoplight</p>
<p>Switched from campsite 2 to Campsite 3, the host said the group previously staying in Camp 2 were climbers that did an all-day climb in Maple Canyon, so they wanted to take it easy and not move out for tonight.</p>
<p>Setup was pretty straightforward, though my camping light stopped working due to rusted-out batteries... I gotta get new ones tomorrow I suppose. It was only a matter of time. After taking off my shoes, my socks smelled SO bad. Usually I don't have such a problem with foot odor but since they've been trapped in socks and driving all day, it's just been... bad. It's been pretty dry all day and I got clogged sinuses and a minor nosebleed. My left eye also started hurting a lot, like there's some kind of hair or particle constantly rubbing at it. I put in extra eyedrops but it still hurts... really hope it doesn't cause an infection or anything. Period is also still intense, but hopefully less so.</p>

<!-- D A Y : 3 ---------------------------------------->
<h2>Sunday - Aug 11, 2024</h2>
<h3>Devil's Kitchen, Ponderosa-Uinta Campground, UT</h3>
<p>Woke up at 5AM Utah time and wrote down a weird dream I had, then went back to sleep because it was still dark. I really needed to pee but I didn't want to use the vault toilet with my period still going kind of intensely. So I packed up, brushed my teeth, then drove off to see the Devil's Kitchen (which happened to be right around the same area as the campsite!). Also found a cut on my inner lip which HURT, thought it was getting cracked from how dry it is but it feels like a puncture of some kind. I ate one slice of the leftover pizza and ended up still using a vault restroom, albeit in a less populated area. After that I finally got ready and set off on the hike, which... was a lot shorter than expected. Like it wad literally 5 minutes walking to the viewpoint. But it was good that it was short because from the campground to the evening's campsite it would be just under 9h drive.</p>
<p>There were infoboards of the different plants found along the trail, it was really cool to read about them!</p>
<p>The formations were gorgeous though! Stunningly red rocks punctured by other smaller greyish pebbles, and ones that made little curved arcs.</p>

<h3>Dino Bones at Mygatt-Moore Quarry, CO</h3>
<p>Atlas Obscura came though with this one in McInnis Canyon!</p>
<p>Very hot 90deg 1.5mi hike. I didn't document my whole trek because I forgot to start it at the beginning, but I logged most of the hike on Alltrails.</p>
<p>There was one other group there in a car but they had finished the hike right before I did and I didn't interact with them.</p>
<p>Started listening to the nutritionist Dr. Michael Gregor's book, though I didn't get very far. I started thinking back to Braiding Sweetgrass again.</p>

<h3>Grand Junction, CO</h3>
<p>Got a whooooole bunch of things in Target (which was connected to a shopping center called Mesa Mall). Got batteries for my busted light, sunbum sunscreen that my friend Di recommended, got tampons (which actually really suck, the CORA brand makes terrible tampons), and also extra Tylenol since I was running out. I went back to use the restroom, toss some more garbage, and grab more Waterloo sparkling water because I ran out. I got a "summer berry" flabor which is like strawberry, blueberry, and blackberry, and the colors were all patriotic-looking so maybe it had to do with a 4th-of-kuly campaign.</p>
<p>I went to find food downtown and ended up at <a href="#/" target="_blank">___</a> because it had good reviews. I got a black bean panini and it had cactus in it! It was a bit spicy but really tasty and filling, and the side of fries it came with was SO much better than yesterday's fries at SLC.</p>
<p>I also ended walking around a bit to stretch my legs and wandered into a thrift(?) place called <a href="#/" target="_blank">___</a>. I ended up getting this cute stretchy red top! A little souvenir from Grand Junction haha.</p>
<p>Formation that towered over the city, like some kind of temple carved with love. But instead of human hands, it was the hands of time and the breath of climate that made it so beautiful.</p>

<h3>No Name Rest Area in White River Canyon, CO</h3>
<p>Before I found the rest area I passed by a really cute-looking town. Some of the accents of buildings were painted a deep vivid mahogany-red color, like maroon but more saturated deep-red. Just absolutely stunning. It also had a spa in it called Vapor Spa, I wonder if that's the one I saw on Atlas Obscura... I kind of want to go! Maybe if there's time tomorrow I'll check it out.</p>
<p>Super gorgeous scenery all around, it was funny that the rest area was literally called "No Name." I was planning to nap but took a walk instead.</p>
<p>Really interesting plants when I walked away-ish from the parking lot towards the White River (which wasn't white, but very brown). They looked like little wire sculptures dipped in soap or very thin wax, and left to dry until it became paper-like. But the little seed-pods were like a beautiful field of glittering silver. They didn't make any noise, but I imagined that if they did, it would be like a million tiny tinkling fairy windchimes, just flittering so delicately.</p>
<p>On the way forwards as I passed by Avon, CO, going through all the tunnels and seeing the rock formations and how beautoful everything was made me cry. It was just so gorgeous. I'm excited to see more of it tomorrow, and was thinking that Colorado might be a serious contender to Portland in terms of places to just... exist. It made me think... maybe I was too quick to pull the trigger on Portland, what if I had done more of the digital nomading before settling down? But I'm glad I ended up in Portland, for the people and all the actual vegan options, the community and the feeling of home. Yes... no matter how appealing other places might be, PDX is home.</p>

<h3>Vail</h3>
<p>I stopped in Vail because I heard it was a very popular ski resort. Driving and trying to find parking was a struggle, and I took a wrong turn and saw a couple valets snickering at me, like, they made eye contact and started laughing with each other. I suppose it's just bored folks who see some dumb tourist doing dumb tourist things, but it was still a smidge embarrasing. But finally found parking in a garage, though parking for 10-20 mins cost $10! For 20-30m it was $20! Luckily I only had to pay $10, but still... so much. I went to grab something caffeinated from <a href="https://www.yetisgrind.com" target="_blank">Yeti's Grind</a> and got a VERY mediocre matcha, and it was $8-- SO not worth it. Also for some VERY odd reason it smelled like fish?? I also desperately needed to use a restroom but the women's bathroom was closed for cleaning. So I just walked straight into the men's room. No one else was using the restroom (there was only one stall, though it was surprisingly clean) but after some folks passed though and did their business at the urinals, the cleaning lady seemed to want to start on the men's room. So I wrapped up and exited, and we made eye contact though no one said anything, and then I finally left to try to get to the campsite. Thinking back, I literally paid $10 to take a shit in the men's bathroom in Vail.</p>

<h3>Outlaw Hideaway at Scraggy Camp in Green Mountain Ranch, CO</h3>
<p>There was a white truck that rolled coal at a car that was going a little slower (not even under the limit, just being slower than the truck wanted). Then later after getting off I-70 East, either the same white truck or different (it had been like an hour or two since the previous occurrence) rolled coal at another car! And then after the car changed lanes and slowed down, I ended up behind the truck and it rolled coal at me too?! So ridiculous, I literally didn't do anything.</p>
<p>There was this one area on the long and windy way to the campsite which looked a lot like Vernonia/on the way to coastal northern Oregon, and it made me feel homesick. So I suppose that really and truly, PDX is home. I missed my bed, I missed my plants. I missed watching Ty play games and spending time together. I missed being home without having obligations, of wondering if I have enough time to do all that I want to do, because there's only so much to do at home. It's like a conundrum. Adventures and feeling good outside, or staying in and feeling a different kind of good?</p>
<p>It was a struggle following directions to get to the campsite. The host sent an intimidating list of considerations and how-to-get-there's, and I was so tired... Just felt my eyes get all droopy. But I finally got to the campsite at 8:30PM Utah time, and I felt accomplished! This is my first time camping through Hipcamp, the instructions and to-do's always felt so confusing before but now I understand it a little better.</p>
<p>The designated parking area for the campsite was also at a slope, so I walked to where the tent area was and checked if the Subie could fit up there instead. I had to kick a few VERY large rocks out of the way first, but I ended up driving the Subie up the slope, and then finally started setup.</p>
<p>Got quite creeped out while taking a leak deeper in the woods, there was this log that kind of looked like a crouching person and I felt the hair on the back of my neck get all prickly. Kept feeling like I was being watched, and the woods are pretty quiet, even though I just methodically set things up like usual. I didn't start feeling safer until I put up all my windows and did the fairy lights.</p>
<p>At least one mosquito and 2 moths entered the car while I was setting up, and I tried to use the flashlight on my phone to lead them out, but it didn't work. I didn't want my allergies to kick up from the moth, and I REALLY don't want to get bit by a mosquito, but I suppose it's a little late for it because the moth dust made me itchy. It also started to rain wuite a bit while I was writing this out. Responded to some messages and surprisingly there was signal!</p>

<!-- D A Y : 4 ---------------------------------------->
<h2>Monday - Aug 12, 2024</h2>
<h3>Little Scraggy Camp</h3>
<p>Woke up feeling alright, I actually slept through the night!</p>
<p>As I drove off and towards Denver, I started thinking about the human relationship with earth once again. We aren't humans of the earth anymore, we're moreso organisms of asphalt. Our feet barely touch the dirt anymore, aside from when we're on vacation. We spend more time in shoes and houses and cars and on pavement than we do on dirt or clay or "earth." We're separated from that "earth" by all the manmadeness. It's not so much an actionable item, but moreso an observation...</p>

<h3>Roxborough Park, CO</h3>
<p>The park was SUPER cool! But entering it was confusing, the sign for the golf course and th country club next to the park was WAY more prominent than literally that of the (spectacular) park. I had accidentally turned into the golf area, and had to make a U-turn out.</p>
<p>There were so many amazing red-rock formation, so incredible. And lots of wildflowers and organisms that I've both seen and not seen before.</p>
<p>Saw these really neat bugs just chillin on milkweed.</p>

<h3>Fluid Coffee Bar in Denver, CO</h3>
<p>Toy RC driver was just making the little car zoom on a proper street with real cars on it. That little toy was SUPER fast though, the guy had really good control over the car.</p>
<p>I was originally going to go to Plant Magic Cafe in Denver but they had a sign on their door that said they wouldn't be open until Wednesday... which is a bummer because I may never go to Denver again! Bits of Denver were really cool though, the neighborhoods have charm and the people seem pretty diverse.</p>
<p><a href="#" target="_blank">Fluid Coffee Bar</a> is really cute though! I walked 10 mins to get there and opted not to drive again for a little bit just to stretch legs. The store has colorful paper cranes hanging from their ceiling and there's an area where people can work from cafe computers. I got an iced hazlenut oat latte and a burrito that wasn't housemade (it was reheated and even had the original wrapper it came in still wrapped around it, and it tasted SO similar to the one I had in a cafe at Lake O.), but the coffee was great though. I stayed for quite a while waiting for my phone to charge (it kept disconnecting from the Subie and also the power that Google Maps and Spotify used seemed to drain it faster than it could properly charge.)</p>
<p>While there I also decided to book a visit to Yampah Spa in Glenwood. Glenwood is the town with the really cute brick and reddish-painted buildings! It was so hot outside and my period is on it's way out, so I thought it'd be a great idea to go, thenk walk around the town afterwards since3 it caught my eye so much on the way to Denver.</p>
<p>I didn't have any swimwear for the pools, so I first went to REI along the way back, and then Target when I couldn't find any good options at REI.</p>

<h3>Tom the Hitchhiker</h3>
<p>Leaving both REI and Target in Dillon, I was headed right for Glenwood when I saw a hitchhiker actually making the hitchhiker thumb at the freeway entrance. So I literally pulled into a little slot and was facing the wrong direction from the Freeway, and I told him to get in quick. It all happened so fast that I didn't even comprehend what I was actually doing, was just thinking that if I were a hitchhiker in the heat it'd be nice if someone did the same for me. Got no clue and forgot to ask how long he waited, but I was also worried in the heat of the moment, if I didn't pull over for him, would somebody else do it? Apparently he lives in Revelstoke, Canada, which is west of Banff but East of Whistler. He is a thru-hiker that just completed a massive hike from Albuquerque, NM to Colorado, and he was headed to Avon to see his friend. Apparently bro's hiked all over the world before, in Spain, France, Italy, New Zealand, and Tasmania in Australia.</p>

<h3>Yampah Pools</h3>
<p>Seriously think White River Canyon in the Rockies are one of the most beautiful places on earth. Just the rock formations, the way the freeway is constructed, the river, the reddish rocks and the chapparal secondary successors... just so incredibly it's own beautiful thing.</p>
<p>The facilities were really cool at <a href="https://yampahspa.com" target="_blank">Yampah Spa</a>! "Yampah" means "Big Medicine" in the language of the Ute Natives in the land. While marinating in the pool I kept thinking about the frog foreman from Spirited Away saying "Oh no, that's our best herbal formula!" when Chihiro used a fancy herbal bath token from No-Face. I imagined myself as one of the duck spirits just floating in an herbal bath, except instead of ducks we were all mildly-to-severely sunburnt humans, and instead of herbs it's a bunch of random minerals. The water apparently has high amounts of sulfate, nitrate, zinc and potassium. I didn't pay the premium to go see Vapor Caves, but maybe it would have been worth it. It was nice either way because there was a part of the pool I focused on (around 100) that had a fake waterfall thing that dumped water down so hard it felt like a back massage, and right as I finished changing and entered the pool area, the mineral baths turned to an adult-only section. No screaming children, hooray!</p>
<p>It felt SO good to be clean, got my first shower in 2.5 days and goodness gracious, just being able to wash everything was so excellent.</p>

<h3>Glenwood, CO</h3>
<p>Before heading to Ridgway, I got pizza from <a href="https://www.rockymountainpizzagws.com" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain Pizza Co.</a> which was super delicious and filling enough that I have two slices left for tomorrow's breakfast! I got the "Caprese" with a garlic-basil-olive oil base, and it also had vegan cheese, heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, and balsamic reduction. Legit one of the best medium-crust pizzas I've had.</p>
<p>The drive to the AirBnB in Ridgway was 2h 50ish mins, and it was H E F T Y. But I also had leftover coffee along with the pizza. I called Ty and my mom and brother. Kept following this ambulance truck (which wasn't an actively siren-ing one) that was going 80MPH most of the way. It was a struggle the last hour-ish because my eyes were getting droopy, and thoughts started to wander. I thought back to when my mom would make the drive from OR to CA, how we woke really early and how some of my earliest memories are of looking out the window of the backseat of a car at a slowly lightening night sky. The fields we had passed were the same ones that I remembered the first time I returned to Corvallis as an adult. It's silly and I don't actually believe in fate or destiny, but as the wandering progressed I felt like maybe I was destined to be on the road forever, that I couldn't escape road trips even if I tried. They'd just always come back in some way shape or form, and if I wasn't a passenger then I'd be the driver. Just a constant journey and that maybe Portland isn't the home that I thought it was (even though taking a step back this isn't true), that I had no home. I've moved place to place so often as a young kid that maybe the idea of "home" just doesn't exist. That I'll never actually attain a consistent comfort of home or a "place," and that I don't deserve to feel safe or settled, and my place was really just being on some road forever, constantly seeking the next spot to rest, then keep going again. Those feelings kept me alive and fighting a few years ago, it's maybe some form of survival that's hard to snap out of sometimes.</p>
<p>Right before arriving in Ridgway, I saw a lit up wire-and-red-string-light sculpture of what looked like a human-sized being in someone's yard, legit Satan vibes and helped with snapping out of ruminating Maybe it was an art installation, maybe a prank for drivers.</p>

<h3>AirBnB in Ridgway, CO</h3>
<p>Arrived at the AirBnB and actually got to talk with Nicole the host! She helped walk me through what was where and handed me the keys directly so I didn't have to struggle to figure anything out. Just a really considerate host and the room was very clean and cozy-looking.</p>
<p>I saw a massive moth in the bathroom!</p>
<p>Didn't end up catching the Perseids just because it's cloudy and also I'm just WAY too tired. I didn't reply to most of my messages either... that can be a tomorrow task.</p>

<h2>Tuesday - Aug 13, 2024</h2>
<h3>Ridgway, CO</h3>

<h3>Sheep's Corral</h3>
<p>I drove to Carhenge to meet up with the volunteer foraging group. Lily, Anna, Kai (dyed ends on hair, works with mental health counseling), and I all got into Ryan's car to carpool to Road 63L. We were confused on how to get there and we lost which way the others had gone, but we all arrived there eventually. Brian the trip lead handed us all a bunch of P. cyanescens capsules that we could either take there or wherever, and I saved mine because I didn't want anything to affect my driving/focus ability. Maybe one day when the time is right they will get consumed.</p>

<h3>La Cocina de Luz</h3>
<p>Originally Anna wanted to try a thai place but we couldn't go in because the wait time would have been over an hour. We saw Allie, another volunteer who I had seen but not interacted with, and we decided to all find food and eat together. The second place we tried was a spot called Wood Ear, which also Got a vegan platter.</p>
<p>Allie</p>

<h3>Driving back to Ridgway</h3>
<p>Severe thunderstorms, and there were huge patches of lightning occasionally that just went across the entire sky and lit everything up. The sky turned from dusk to night and then it was completely dark. The road was so rained-upon that I hydroplaned a few times, and there was a very impatient car behind me (even though I went mostly the speed limit). I didn't want to drive back so late, but this was my chance to really try to make volunteer friends. I don't think any will stick though, even if it was really cool talking with everyone and sharing meals together.</p>
<p>After arriving back to the AirBnB I literally had to RUN to the backdoor area because the rain was still pounding so hard. It felt so nice to just shower and get out of the rain.</p>

<h3>Foray Time!</h3>
<p>Amy Honan and Alan Rockefeller</p>
<p>Rode with Adam.</p>
<h4>Galloping Goose</h4>
<p>I snagged some black velvet fabric from Alan to use as a background for foraged specimens. Found tiny specimens and split off from Alan's group to go with Amy. When I found bird's nest fungi</p>
<p>Rode with Lynx</p>
<h4>Sheep's Corral</h4>
<p>We ended up at Sheep's Corral again. I didn't think I'd see anything new, but I found lion's mane! Apparently Adam didn't get the memo from Mandy (Alan's partner) that I had gone with Lynx and Amy's group to a secondary location, and apparently was asking where I was. I talked with a guy called Eddie who let the main group know that he'd seen me. I felt guilty for not making sure Adam knew, and really hoped that I didn't mess up their foraging time. After I rejoined the group though, everyone was really surprised that I'd found lion's mane (Hericium sp.)!</p>
<h4>Heading Back</h4>
<p>Heather also needed a ride and I was looking through the window when she was kind of chasing a car she had arrived in. Luckily Michael was able to clear the back seat of his truck and Heather could fit. Michael from Nebraska, but who now lives in Denver. He really likes watching boxing because the best guy in his opinion was from his home state. We talked also about the Henry-Doorley Zoo in Nebraska, which Heather had gone to as well when she was a kid, and she said she actually slept next to the jellyfish! When my mom was in Kansas, I remember we went to the Henry-Doorley Zoo too, and the jellyfish and aquatic life was definitely the most memorable. I had this purple t-shirt that I wore to death from there. Heather is from Vegas and we also discovered that she found Hericium sp. too! Her specimen was even larger and more clean, definitely felt like she should have gotten WAY more of the lion's mane hype.</p>
<p>Heather, and Ross from Denver.</p>

<h3>Ah Haa in Telluride</h3>
<p>The Ah Haa building was very artsy-modern-design-y.</p>
<p>A handful of folks came over wanting to see the Hericium sample, and so I kept trying to get people to take notice of Heather's specimen too (we were sitting together). It was wild how much attention the lion's mane got, and there was even a person making a movie that filmed our specimens. Apparently it will be on the </p>

<h3>Telluride, CO</h3>
<p>ID van with Heather</p>
<p>Walked with Heather back to Carhenge so she could pick up more mushroom samples that she found yesterday. We talked about periods and different types of trees, and her two cats (one of them is named Kanye).</p>
<p>Check-in and vendor tent. I got my festival t-shirt!</p>

<h3>Mountain Village, CO</h3>
<p>Gondola ride up, with guy getting married at a ranch below the Coors Beer Mountains tmr, and his maid of honor. The to-be-married guy knew SO much about Telluride and mountain village, it was clear he LOVED where he lives and apparently had been living in Telluride for 6-ish years. Older couple who had been to Telluride once before.</p>
<p>Exploring Mountain Village</p>
<p>On the way down there was a retired couple and their friend, and this lady who looked like she was mega-rich and her family member person who wasn't her daughter (maybe her niece?) and the girl was literally drop-dead gorgeous. Like the lady too, they were both wearing super delicate jewelry, had very traditionally "beautiful" facial features and had their hair and makeup done super perfectly. I wondered if they were influencers. The girl's 24th birthday is tomorrow and apparently she graduated grad school recently from New York in Journalism. She's really going places! The retired woman of the couple and their friend bonded with the girl since they were all in the mountain-biking scene.</p>

<h3>Ridgway, CO</h3>
<p>On the way back there was a truck that was tailgating the shit out of this red van.</p>
<p>Pizza from the bar across the street, they actually had vegan mozzarella. The pizza was a little sour/tangy because the artichoke hearts weren't cooked crispy. I messaged Nicole the AirBnB host that I was thinking of taking a day off early just to get a head start on the drive back.</p>

<h2>Thursday - Aug 15, 2024</h2>
<h3>Telluride Mushroom Festival</h3>
<p>Volunteering started off well! The other Ryan finally arrived and we both ran to get coffee at Viceroy since our shifts started at 8AM and Paul the manager said we could do whatever before then. Ryan was having trouble downloading the Sched app on his phone and getting things to connect. I got a blueberry matcha and we both returned. Reed the other volunteer seemed pretty aloof and it was difficult to try to have a conversation with someone who didn't seem to even want to try to be friends. He's definitely a different kind of person, very into music festival life and he's going to Tenessee next, and he tye-dyes the t-shirts of bands as a business, but also grows mushrooms on the side. But he talks a lot about the "sphere" and he lives in Denver. When I said I was nervous about volunteering at the Puff Ball (some kind of dance that goes until midnight) he just looked at me blankly then looked to his phone. Just have a feeling he really doesn't like me for whatever reason. I mean, we really don't have anything in common aside from mushrooms, and he wouldn't start conversations, so it's ok because he's not someone I'd prefer to spend time with either, but it's difficult and awkward when we have to be in the same area and conversation feels so forced. Luckily he volunteered to go help laminate stuff so he was gone for a good bit of time.</p>
<p>Britt Bunyard was the first speaker.</p>
<p>I started helping the VR guy set up his meta headsets to connect to the wifi</p>
<p>There was a lady whose name started with "J" that wanted to attend lectures but she had a dog with her that wasn't a service dog. I said if she keeps him outside I could watch him, and she seemed really happy about it. And so I spent most of my shift with Juno the pup. Originally I thought his name is "June" but I saw he was a boy and was wondering why his name is June. Like humans, dogs can be named anything, but was confused at first. Ryan came back after browsing the festival and Exploring, and I took off to explore for a bit too. I saw some vendor tents that were giving out free samples of things, and I got to try this mushroom lemon-blueberry soda thing from <a href="https://www.petrichormushrooms.com" target="_blank">Petrichor</a> which was pretty good and refreshing! I also got to talk with Chris Adams (who remembered me but not my name) and got to meet his little son who gave me a free sticker.</p>
<p>Juno's owner came back and she said she wanted to get me coffee. I joked and said "I won't say no to that!" and we talked for a bit more but she thought I was serious. And I said "oh no I was joking I really don't need coffee, spending time with Juno was enough" because it REALLY was. Like omg I would have had to sit in awkward silence with Reed and occasionally Paul. But she was so nice, she actually went to a vendor tent and bought me mushroom earrings! They're super cute and made out of real mushrooms, and it was honestly so nice of her. When I went to see the price of the earrings they were literally $40. Jewelry is expensive, but holy crap! Just for petting her dog and doing something I'd rather have been doing anyways.</p>
<p>As we neared 12:30PM when our shift was to end, Paul said we could take off if we had a lecture that we wanted to attend. And Reed left when there was still time left on the shift, but I stayed back a little bit to talk with Paul and Ryan, to wait for the Group 6 volunteers to arrive. Chris and Robin (an older volunteering couple who call themselves "Christopher Robin") came to replace us. We chatted briefly and then I took off too. Apparently Ryan was planning to take the gondola up to Mountain Village and he had taken some psychedelics right before the shift ended.</p>

<h3>Cordyceps Cultivation at Ah Haa</h3>
<p>While queueing to get a number for the lecture (which was a very desired lecture) I got to talk with Jake and Buddy, who were both from the Mushlove Myco van. After we got our numbers I walked and talked with Jake a bit more since he was originally friends with Kyle from the ID van. Apparently he's from Chicago and came down for the event and to help the van a bit.</p>
<p>I wandered the city a bit and got to the edge where the road leads to Bridal Veil Falls. I was considering going on a hike for a bit but it was just so hot and I was tired.</p>
<p>William Padilla-Brown was the lecturer. He talked about his past and how he got to where he is today. Also about different types of cordyceps. Apparently they like to stay in temperatures around 65deg, so on the cooler side. All the talk attendees got to take home a sample of cooked rice and hemp meal inoculated with liquid cordyceps.</p>

<h3>Cultivation and Cloning Talk at Elks Park</h3>
<p>By the Mycolove Van folks, Michael and Steve were talking. Ryan form Group 4 was also there and we sat together. I texted Heather the event and hoped she could come by too, and she did, so our group grew! Anna was also there but she sat a ways away. They talked about different technoques to cultivate fungi, by using liquid cultures vs agar agar in petri dishes, and also taking an agar sample and making it into a liquid culture. IT's so wild that any part of a mushroom can produce mycelium and keep living as a clone.</p>

<h3>Vendor Tents</h3>
<p>I talked with the <a href="https://poogodco.com" target="_blank">Poo God</a> stand (LOL what a name) and they sold a BUNCH of very psychoactively desirable mushroom grow kits. They didn't sell the shrooms themselves though, just huge ones on display. They called the strain a "pumpkin" and the caps were literally dinner-plate sized.</p>
<p>I was really considering getting a tattoo in a popup setting but I decided against it. The art wasn't really something I favored even if it would be a good souvenir.</p>

<h3>Ridgway, CO</h3>
<p>Got dinner from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-paradise-ridgway" target="_blank">Thai Paradise</a> when I came back. Got Thai salad rolls with sweet and sour sauce, and also mango sticky rice for dessert, which I only ate a little bit of but am saving for tomorrow. While waiting for food I walked around and happened upon a nearby grocery store, and went in to buy peanut butter. I saw that Nicole saw my message but didn't reply, and so I submitted the trip date change request. My mosquito bite on my chin looks insanely huge, it's like I have two chins.</p>

<h2>Friday - Aug 16, 2024</h2>
<h3>Ridgway</h3>
<p>Face was super swollen from the mosquito bite that I had to put a bandaid over it. It still looked like I have two chins, and I felt self-conscious but moreso worried, since my neck was starting to itch.</p>

<h3>Early Morning Foray</h3>
<p>Met at Carhenge and then walked to the Telluride gondola station. Went on Gondola to San Sophia Station (the midpoint between Telluride and Mountain Village). Foraged a tiny strawberry for the first time. I slipped a couple times and skidded on > 45-deg dirt, but also found some REALLY cool sheep's polypores (Albatrellus sp.) that were infected by some kind of Hypomyces. Someone else found Matsutake! Got hungry and started eating peanut butter, but then lost the group. I somehow stumbled upon TONS of wild raspberries and foraged a hefty handful. I started trtying to make my way back to the San Sophia Station, and had to use maps. On the way, I ate all the raspberries. After I got back to the meeting location, everyone had already laid out their collections and they said anything folks didn't want, they were just going to toss. I didn't want the matsutake to go to waste so I called dibs on it and bagged it to bring to the Mycolove ID van.</p>
<p>Rode back with members of the mycogroup.</p>

<h3>Telluride Mushroom Festival</h3>
<p>Farmer's market, talked with the Telluride Mushroom Company and they had lots of chanterelles but nothing else of note which was a little disappointing.</p>
<p>Blueberry Matcha from Viceroy</p>
<p>Talked with vendors. Candycaps from Mayumi Fujio from SF. Dropped off specimens. Looked at bark beetle and C. volvatus caterpillar with Kyle from the Mycolove van.</p>

<h3>Volunteering</h3>
<p>Gemma the vendor needed help watching her tent and had to get food from Moab Kitchen, and oxygen from the corner store, and I offered to help. After she returned I had been eyeing her wares and ended up buying an outfit set (shirt and long skirt made in Bali). She gave me $20 off, though the overall outfit as pricy af.</p>
<p>Reed's eyes were red as fuck. It was very apparent that he had consumed something and was vaguely out of it.</p>
<p>Kathleen Harrison's Big Botanical Beings talk about traditional uses of psychedelic plants and mushrooms. I really wanted to listen but honestly the start of her presentation was quite boring, the pace was slow, and it was a lot of hype. After she said "imagine fungi and plants as looking up at us, seeing all the war and bad stuff, and saying 'we want to get into your heafs and make change'," I was done. It was so human-centric and felt very much self-centered and unrealistic, just unscientific infactual hypothetic fan-fictioning, and so I left the theater room and went to sit back at the entrance. Yes, I literally got out of that talk and chose to go back to where Reed was.</p>
<p>I took a short break to go and talk with some vendors and grab food.</p>
<p>Towards the end I just started uploading my stuff to iNaturalist because I didn't have anything else really to do</p>

<h3>Down the Rabbit Hole 3.0 with Tradd Cotter</h3>
<p>6:30pm - 7:30pm MDT</p>
<p>Best presentation ever.</p>
<p>Mycoremediation</p>
<p>Mycopesticides</p>
<p>Combatting anti-bacterial risks of bacteria using fungi</p>

<h3>Ridgway</h3>
<p>Sewed part of the shirt that I bought fromn Gemma so the fit is better. I used the emergency needle and thread that I had brought. The air is very dry and I constantly felt thirsty.</p>
