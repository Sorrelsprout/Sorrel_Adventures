<h2>Thursday - Feb 1, 2024</h2>
<p>Woke up this morning at 4:30 AM (the usual time) then went back to bed until 5AM. I tried to get more shuteye but couldn't, then at 6:30 FINALLY stumbled out of bed after looking at Reddit for who knows how long. It wasn't even interesting stuff! But it passed time and calmed the travel nerves... I started finishing up dishes and showered and packed up the remaining stuff that needed to be brought (chargers, toothbrush, etc...) and also took out trash and unplugged everything from outlets just in case. While prepping, my neighbors texted me wondering if I was free for coffee, but I didn't get to answer until I got on the bus. It was a hefty trip to the airport! I took Bus 15 all the way down and got on the wrong transportation (took the MAX Green Line in the opposite direction instead of the MAX Green Line Shuttle), but got there eventually!</p>
<p>I also snagged a ticket for the Telluride Mushroom Festival in August, so that trip is legitimately happening! Am pretty shocked that I got an earlybird ticket (which was only a $50 discount), but I also signed up to volunteer so hopefully the cost will be reimbursed if I'm accepted. Feel a big relief that I could sign up but nervous about planning for that one now though... I snagged it RIGHT after I got off the bus 15 to transfer to the green MAX line.</p>
<p>After arriving at PDX proper, finally got the chance to engulf the rice paper rolls with peanut sauce that I'd made earlier with fennel, kale, and leftover carrots. Who knew the usual salad combo would be so good as a rice paper roll!</p>

<h3>PDX boarding</h3>
<p>I first went to the Alaska Airlines help desk because the Alaska Airlines app and website wouldn't allow me to use the confirmation code. There was a man trying to bring a HUGE bottle of either pills or medicine or some chemical substance, and the only available non-elite agent was helping him out. So I ended up waiting about 20-25 minutes for the guy to be helped, and coult tell the person in front of me was also getting antsy. In the end we were helped by the elite agents stepping in and who knows? Maybe to this day the guy is still trying to bring his bottle through...</p>
<p>2h Layover</p>
<p>Anyways, finally entered the screening line and I had some metal bits in my jeans that this TSA lady had to pat me down for. After that I went to Stumptown Coffee and got an oat milk chai. I felt like it might be hard for vegans on a trip like this... I got to the gate and waited only a while and texted back everyone that I missed messages from, then boarded.</p>
<p>I got an aisle seat next to a man who was very immersed in his sudoku puzzle, and actually felt nervous for the first flight! My hands were super shaky because of the coffee and also the tubulence and anticipation for takeoff really stimulated my anxiety. Practiced tapping my fingers in a pattern and it somewhat helped... the clouds and scenery were really pretty though!</p>

<h3>SEA boarding</h3>
<p>After arriving in SEATAC I followed the signage to try and reach the S Gate, but the shuttle trams were kind of confusing, and almost missed where I was supposed to go if it wasn't for a helpful guy who noticed me squinting at a tram map. Right before the doors closed he pointed me in the right direction and I was able to board the correct tram. There was one more tram switch after that and then FINALLY got to gate S1. Checked in with the desk attendants to get my passport revalidated, and then charged my phone to 80% and messaged people back. Then went to buy these overpriced trail mix/nuts from a convenience store (2 small bags of nuts for $20, isn't that crazy?) and boarded the bog boi flight.</p>
<p>It was more packed than expected, but got a window seat that I'd previously selected which was nice. It's a bummer we're flying mostly in the dark because I bet the scenery over Canada is amazing... It was honestly a relief that I charged my phone because there were NO outlets and no USBC ports. During the flight I used my pocket strings to practice some chords, refreshed some super basic Icelandic vocab phrases, and then did some journaling. Had to write everything down because I didn't want to waste phone battery and also didn't have access to the internet anyways. But did end up writing a new song! I'm calling it "Airway Wanderlust," inspired by the sunset and feelings from this trip so far. All that's left is coming up with the melody and lots of practice.</p>
<p>But honestly it was very uncomfortable on the flight. I didn't have the full aisle to myself like I'd expected, and there is at least one dingus a few rows back who was OBVIOUSLY sick (and likely multiple) and would cough every 5 mins. I'm glad I had a P100 mask but with this confined space and no eye protection... I'm scared. I REALLY don't want to get COVID nor give it to any of my friends when getting back. It's frustrating that whoever's wet-coughing is just in the normal flight environment, no quarantine, nothing! And SO many unmasked folks too, just no fear at all from them? Tried to nap and covered my head with the blankets that IcelandAir gave out, but couldn't sleep for more than an hour or so. I also was too worried to eat or drink because of all the coughers, so I saved two small canned tonic waters and the in-flight vegan salad thing till after arriving in Reykjavík.</p>

<h2>Friday - Feb 2, 2024</h2>
<h3>Keflavík Airport</h3>
<p>Landed in Keflavík at 6AM! It was a hefty flight but made it. Went to use the restroom and then followed some folks to the baggage claim area, hoping to reach the FlyBus boarding area. I met a lady named Amanda and her buddy Jacob. Jacob carried this huge wooden walking stick. Amanda is from Boston but used to live in east San Jose, CA about 15m from Fremont. Jacob is from Pennsylvania and they both flew from Boston after Amanda drove to pick Jacob up. They flew ALLLL the way from Boston to Seattle and THEN to Iceland vecayse that method was faster and cheaper. I hung out with them for a bit then went to check out FlyBus. they didn't have tickets and wanted to hitchhike to Reykjavík and asked if I wanted to join. Since I already bought the ticket, I boarded without them. We exchanged numbers and said maybe we'd grab lunch together.</p>
<p>I then boarded the FlyBus and met a man called Michael who sat next to me. He was an older dude who reminded me of the VP of my old company who lived on a boat in Sand Diego with his kids. Michael was traveling with a group of his friends (half of which were from South Carolina) and hes also from Boston but took a direct flight. He talked about being excited to see the Aurora Borealis and about different places we'd traveled to. He said he went to the British Virgin Islands and that he lived in a Catamaran for two weeks, and that Maine is his favorite state. I want to visit Maine too, but wonder if they have good non-seafood food options.</p>

<h3>Reykjavík</h3>
<p>After doing a shuttle change, we all finally arrived in the downtown Reykjavík area and I got off at Stop 9. I went to walk around and saw a really odd little pink art gallery. Then went to see if I could leave my duffel at the Skuggi Hotel (Reykjavík Hverfisgata 103). The attendant was very helpful and allowed me to leave my bag in a locked room! So I took my essentials and started walking, and decided to go to Bókasamlagið, where I got a Langloka (sub) Pepperoni and a Beetroot Latte which were both very hearty and needed. I was so excited that it was a FULLY vegan cafe and talked very briefly with the cashier (who used to live in either Ohio or Iowa). She taught me the phrase "sjáumst," which means "see you."</p>

<p>After I was done I asked her recommendation on where best to view the sunrise (it was just vefore 9AM and the sky was starting to lighten) and she suggested to walk to the waterfront but that the sun wouldn't rise until later. I walked to it and on the way, crossed through a roundabout and a slew of different highrise buildings in an oceanfront office park. In the parking lot while trying to let a car by without running me over, I slipped on the ice sideways and hit my arm and hip. I ended up making it throughm though had to go SUPER around to avoid crossing the stroad at a non-intersection.</p>

</div>
<p>The waterfront was so beautiful in a melancholy and haunting sort of way. It reminded me of Hans Christian Anderson's little mermaid story a bit, the gloominess of the ocean was so pretty and yet so dangerous. I also saw some yellow lichen and went to document it on iNaturalist, and as I bent over got a really strong sense of deja vu. Have obviously never been to Iceland before, but at that exact moment, doing that exact thing, feeling and seeing that exact landscape, it was like a brief memory. It was so surreal, like I'd either been there before or had dreamed it. I kept walking towatds the edge of town and it started hailing, And it was so blustery that the hail was diagonally slamming into my eyes and I had to turn back. Took a longer walk around and saw a pink gas station called Orkan, and walked through some deep ice slush... felt thankful for the waterproof tough boots. Was a bit worried I'd get frostbite, so tried walking raster and ducked behind trees while navigating.</p>
<div class="gallery col2">
    <figure><img alt="Reykjavík" src="./images/2024/2024-2-reykjavik/2-2-reykjavik4.jpg"></figure>
</div>
<p>I decided to go to another vegan cafe called Chickpea, and as I went across town, noticed all the apartments/housing units all had very large windows. Icelanders do it right maybe, or just in Reykjavík... having large windows is such a nice mood-booster. I had to duck into another little giftshop on the way after some hailstones actually hurt my eyeballs. I didn't buy anything, but then went into a local grocery shop called Krónan. Originally just wanted to see their mushroom options, but found the refridgerated plant-based milk section, and they sell OATLY YOGURT, and have multiple STRAWBERRY PLANT-BASED DRINKABLE YOGURT options!! I also found some Icekandic throat lozenge candies from this plant called Angelica, which tastes very minty. The checkout system was completely in Icelandic, though I could guess my way through to pay for everything.</p>
<div class="gallery col2"><figure>
    <img alt="Plant-based yogurts" src="./images/2024/2024-2-reykjavik/2-2-reykjavik5.jpg">
    <figcaption>Plant-based yogurts from Krónan</figcaption>
</figure></div>
<p>Right next door to Krónan is Chickpea, which is the vegan cafe I was aiming to go to. I got a salad (#5 beetroot, chickpeas and hummus, onion, and jalapeño, though I took out the jalapeños) and this super creamy and aromatic chai (It was labeled as heitt súkkulaði, which means hot chocolate though) that was super good! I sat there and journaled for a long time while slowly eating the salad and sipping the drink. I wanted to get another drink and keep chilling there and journaling but the shop got more and more crowded until I started feeling uncomfortable. So I packed and returned the dishes and tried to head back to the Skuggi hotel, except that was a huge mistake because there was another huge blizzard that just picked up. The hailstones were blowing at a nearly horizontal angle it was super painful to my eyes... wish I'd brought my ski goggles... still tried to get back but had to duck into many giftshops. They were all mostly the same and I didn't buy anything because I didn't want to buy wool, nor give my friends any low-quality tourist-trappy souveniers, so just kept going.</p>

<h3>Hotel Skuggi</h3>
<p>After finally arrriving back at the hotel, I just chilled in their lounge and journaled a lot and ended up taking a nap. The attendant that I'd spoken with earlier came over and kindly said that the room was ready and asked if I wanted the key so I could nap in the proper room instead. I said no thanks, though, and that I'd wait for the rest of the group to arrive, but maybe I should have accepted because there were no useable outlets in the lounge... how inconvenient.</p>
<p>It was SUPER blustery outside while I was in the lobby, the little hailstones were being swept back and forth by the wind. After resting in the lobby I decided to go exploring once more to kill time.</p>

<h3>Icelandic Phallological Museum</h3>
<p>I walked to the Icelandic Phallological musem and checked it out... it was REALLY something! MEt an older couple who said there were sex museums in Amsterdam but they'd never seen anything like that before. There was a HUMONGOUS sperm whale penis and even ones from a giraffe, zebra, and a couple donated by people? Wild! There were also mythical creature penises that artists had made just for the museum, ones from trolls and mermaids, They also had penis-shaped waffles and themed COCKtails in the cafe/bar area, but I didn't get anything from there.</p>

</figure></div>

<h3>Old Harbor</h3>
<p>After all that I kept walking a little further and went along another stretch of waterfront called the Old Harbor. This time the area had cute little shops and a bunch of tour services all lined up along the pier. It was SO cold that I couldn't type messages, and had to send voicenotes instead. But there were still waterfowl chilling in the ocean even with all the blustery weather and intense cold!</p>

<h3>Hallgrimskirkja</h3>
<p>After walking a little further I saw a Lord of the Rings-esque mural and decided to pivot and visit the largest building in Reykjavík, Hallgrimskirkja which is a Lutheran Church. I didn't go in though. The wind REALLY picked up there and I was literally blown sideways. It was so windy it was hard to open my eyes. I helped a couple take a photo and snapped one myself, then got back to the hotel as fast as possible. Had to duck into some more shops along the way to recover some warmth but didn't get anything again. I don't know what to get my friends! Even all the cool sweaters, socks, and hats are made of wool. I want to support the locals (seems like Iceland REALLY pushes the IceWear brand, it's on ads on the plane and physical posters and billboards around the city), but not at the cost of purchasing/supporting wool.</p>

<h3>Hotel and Tour Group</h3>
<p>I finally went back to Skuggi Hotel around 4:30PM local time and even after half an hour, my thighs were STILL icy cold. Finally finished the chickpea salad though, and the onions were very pungent. I had to go to a store called Extra Barónsstígur, which was along the same street as Skuggi, to buy a european charging adapter though. All the outlets are European which made sense, and there was no USBC charging. But that was another instance of culture shock!</p>
<p>So I finally met the group! There's Fara and Mo who are from Toronto, Canada (but used to live in New Zealand). Alice (mom of 2 from Surrey and who also works at our tour company) and her twin Katie (who is vegan and from Cambridge). There were two other americans, Nancy (who is a teacher) and her husband Brad (who is a lawyer). Apparently my soon-to-be roommate was still on her flight over.</p>
<p>Our tour guide Jura accidentally had an extra room booked for herself when we met (though she has a home nearby), so my to-be roommate and I got basically our own rooms for the night. I was so excited to have the room (especially the bathroom) all to myself! I could pick which bed I wanted. The place was clean and cozy, and the bathroom looked clean and manageable. I could leave my stuff anywhere and no one cared haha. We all had to check out first thing in the morning anyways. I was crossing my fingers that Katie and I would have vegan options for breakfast.</p>
<p>After putting our stuff in our rooms, we reconvened to walk to the nearest food-court-like-hub nearby, but when we got there it was SUPER crowded. We all kind of dispersed and went to find out food options. I tagged along with Alice and Katie and they ended up getting vegan tacos and drinks. I also got a drink, one called a "Blue Gin Reykjavík" which had flower petals and some kind of flavored crystals in it. I had most of it, it wasn't too big. I thought to myself, that I didn't have a problem with alcohol, I would be fine. I was with new folks and I wanted to try new things. I don't even really know what a gin is, and honestly didn't really care. We hung out for a while and then headed back to the hotel. I was feeling generally ok and when I was all alone I got cozy on the bed next to the window and started journaling. But then I started to feel so out of it, and I started writing lyrics instead of actual journal entries. Then I fell asleep watching the snow falling on cartops and the glittering decorative lights on the units of other buildings. I woke up a few times throughout the night and could see through some of the windows of the surrounding buildings, at the little vases and plants, at multicolored mood lighting, and could hear a group of rowdy young men having a laugh in their own little world outside the window. The last thing I thought of before dozing for good was wondering what it would be like to live in Reykjavík. To just exist.</p>

<!-- D A Y : 3 ---------------------------------------->
<h2>Saturday - Feb 3, 2024</h2>
<h3>Hotel Skuggi</h3>
<p>Goooood morning Reykjavík! I slept SO hard, the bed was actually super comfy! It was small but the perfect size for me. I woke up at 3AM local time (9AM in Portland time), messaged people back, then re-conked. I finally woke up for good at 7:30AM-ish and got ready, then headed for the included hotel breakfast after packing everything up. I headed to eat, and it was surprisingly good! I got this amazing oatmeal and filled it with sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, dried dates, dried cranberries, and raisins. I saw Nancy and Brad and briefly said hi, then found a little separate corner to really wake up and eat. The breakfast area was quite crowded and I felt a bit nervous with so many people around. While eating I messaged people back and waited for the group to convene. After breakfast I went up to the front desk to check out and asked if I could buy one of their hotel pens, and they just gave me one. My journal pen was running out of ink, so it was extra nice that I got a free souvenir!</p>
<p>I was really curious to meet my to-be-roomie, and thought maybe if we got lucky again that we'd be able to stay in separate rooms again! But we were headed to a different hotel that evening. And then I finally got to meet Aimee. Her luggage was still being held at the airport, and I didn't get to talk with her very much. The last two remaining group members were a mother-daughter duo named Heather and Sally.</p>

<h3>Hafnarfjordur</h3>
<p>We boarded the bus and it was super modern! There were USB charging ports (but no USBC, Euro-outlets, or American outlets). Our first destination was in Hafnarfjordur, and we visited Ishús (Ice House), which is and old fish freezing plant-turned-creative space. The place is an art collective where local craftsfolks could rent a small square footage portion of the building. They had free coffee (which was STRONG) while the Íshús lady was giving her rundown of the space, and I sat at a table with Katie, Aimee, and Alice. We didn't see any of the actual artists but one was a boatbuilder from Australia who met his wife in Iceland and moved there. There were potters (who were the original folks who were onboard with the founders at the conception of the space). The founder lady's husband designed camper trailers and she proclaimed him as a "genius" and her brother was also a spirits-brewer who founded a bar chain that was expanding, called "Ægír."</p>
<p>On the way back to the bus I briefly got to talk with Heather, who was Sally's mother. She assumed I was from Japan for some reason even though I never even talked with her before, which irked me a little bit it's no matter.</p>
<p>On the way to the next location we made a pit stop at a shopping complex, and Jura suggested we get towels for the hot spring if we wanted to. I didn't, but exited the van to check out the complex. There was a bakery and I wanted to get some more coffee, and Alice and Katie were kind of waiting along too. But we didn't realize until after waiting maybe 15 minutes that we had to take a number from a ticket dispenser in order to have our orders taken. The cashiers also spoke only in Icelandic so I was nervous and rehearsing how to order, and what to order (I wanted a vegan pastry too). We took numbers, but ended up leaving without buying anything since we had to get back to the van. I gave my number to a man, who thanked me in Icelandic, "takk fyrir." I wanted to say "you're welcome" back but totally forgot what it was in Icelandic (it's "verði þér að góðu" which there was no way I could remember anyways), or even "bye (bless)" but got tongue tied and so just nodded and followed the twins back to the van.</p>
<p>On the way to Borgarfjörður, Jura talked about the houses and construction history of traditional Icelandic architecture. She also talked about the forests and the fauna. Some native forest species are birches which are short in height, willows which are taller, and beeches which are less common but identifiable through their bark patterns. Birches and willows used to make up 25% on th land, but now only 1% remains. There are reforestation efforts but human impact (people used trees for kindling and overgrazed their herd animals) coupled with volcanic activity wrecked a lot of the landscape (lava fields) and volcanic ash also further wrecked regrowth. An icelandic joke she told was, "what does an Icelander do when they are lost in Iceland? They stand up."</p>
<p>Some fauna she talked about were polar bears (which live in Greenland but migrated to Iceland before climate change wrecked a lot of the sea ice), arctic foxes (which have no predators, so the government pays hunters to prevent overpopulation even though they are native animals), and reindeers (imported for marming and found in the East, and are isolated from West Iceland by giant glaciers). The caf from Íshús was pretty damn strong even with just a few sips, but the jetlag was still hitting and I felt tired. We also passed a 6km tunnel under a Fjord, and while passing through it I fell asleep.</p>

<h3>Barnafossar along the Hvita River in Borgarfjörður</h3>
<p>We finally arrived, and there looked to be a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. I went to the outdoor bathroom which was small and cramped and not the most sanitary, yet still had its own little sink. After entering, Jura opened the door and surprised us both. Luckily there was another one she could use, and it seemed like the restrooms also had a little area where you're supposed to drop payment into a box, but I didn't have any money on me so I didn't... After the restroom I headed into the restaurant to rejoin the group. There was an all-you-can-eat sweet potato soup situation with vread. The soup was slightly spicy and very hearty, and really good to enjoy before checking out the falls. The snow and silence was so serene and it reminded me of the movie "I'm thinking of Ending Things."</p>
<p>I ate with Nancy, Brad, Katie, Alice, Aimee, and Jura. Nancy and Brad finished first and set off for the falls, and then after a bit I left the table too. It was nice walking alone... I like the group a lot but I could breathe and start processing some of the experience better. But after viewing Hraunfossar (which was BLUE! It was a beautiful deep blue color so unique, like a liquid gemstone), I caught up with Nancy and Brad. I talked and walked with them until reaching the first Barnafoss viewpoint. Nancy wanted to head back since the snow was picking up, and Brad wanted to walk a little further so I walked with him for a bit until he also turned back. I wanted to still see what was further, and luckily Alice, Katie, and Aimee just got to where we were too. I read a sign blurb about the story of Barnafoss and took a photo of it so I could read it later out of the cold. I finally had a chance to talk with Aimee more and learned she's from Australia, and we snapped some pictures together at the viewpoint.</p>
<p>Hvita River Folklore</p>

<h3>Krauma Thermal Baths</h3>
<p>The changing tooms looked so modern, and had lockers where the keys to them had little rubber bands that we could use to loop onto our wrists, so that the keys wouldn't get lost while we were in the pools. There weren't too many others there, and we changed into swimwear and spent some time in the first pool (all outdoors!) It wasn't very hot, and walking into it was super cold since we were barefoot and there was snow on the ground. The four of us (Aimee, Katie, Alice) took a cold plunge in the "Punch Bowl" and it was FREEZING! But we did it! Stayed in there for maybe a second and a half, but it was just too cold to stay... after that we quickly ran into the warm pool again and then entered an even hotter pool, and an even hotter one!</p>
<p>In the hottest pool, there was a local (who looked like Pink the singer with her short hair, and the way she carried herself confidently), and she talked with us about different hot springs and told us she owned property around Kreuma. She said she has family and friends from Grindavík who had to evacuate, and she also taught us some vocab.</p>
<p>After she got out of the pool, Heather and Sally (the mom and daughter duo) and I followed her into the Sauna room. It was so hot in there, didn't know if I was still wet from the pools or if I was sweating. I also tried the infrared room, but that one had 3 silent strangers and it felt a bit awkward in there and not as engaging as the pools nor sauna, so left pretty quickly and went back into the changing rooms to shower. The showers had no walls and I felt vulnerable and naked and avoided contact with EVERYONE. The shampoo/body wash smelled nice though, and it felt relaxing!</p>
<p>After showering, I got dressed and went outside to chat briefly with Sally and Heather. Sally said her mom was her ideal travel companion because they were interested in the same things and traveled at the same pace. Sally asked if I traveled with anyone and I said no... maybe one day. It was really... inspiring? To see her and her mom be comfortable with each other so much that they could do adventures together, and I want a travel companion like that. In family trips it's always been exhausting with all the yelling and stepping on eggshells, but I wonder if things would be different if it was just me and my mom? I get a little stressed just thinking about it. After all that, Aimee came back and the group all rejoined and we went back to the bus.</p>
<p>On the bus to the next hotel I vibed to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1ghaBtBdpuZMg5nV9E2qRU?si=cf2f241489024919" target="_blank">Don't Let it Pass</a> by Junip, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZNYGrmcehorhh9JOeg5Iv?si=c166e8a961f24f92" target="_blank">Stay Alive</a> by José Gonzales, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/616yEEd2w2dBiHk2P6Y6H8?si=d9c3979be5a94522" target="_blank">Swimmers (Hushed)</a> by Andrew Belle. I kept "Swimmers" on repeat and just looked out the window at the scenery. It was so icy, and white, and grey, and so... detachedly beautiful. The song has some falsetto in it that went really well with the scenery. We stopped briefly at a gas station and I was in and out of naps. Serious props to Jura for staying awake throughout and keeping us safe.</p>

<h3>Hveragerði</h3>
<p>We finally arrived at the hotel and got to drop off the luggage. The room is so nice looking and modern, and also the windows are SO big, like FULL wall windows. I finally got to talk more with Aimee, and she's really cool and chill! We went down to meet with the rest of the group. We went across the street to a food hall called <a href="https://thegreenhouse.is" target="_blank">Gróðurhúsið / Greenhouse</a>, and I got a vegan Yuzu Burger from this vendor called <a href="https://yess.is/yuzu-grodurhusid" target="_blank">Yuzu</a>, and it was so tasty, I snorfed it down so fast. Alice bought our little group of four drinks, and I got a non-alcoholic mojito. Since we were all talking so much, I kept putting water in my drink to dilute and melt the ice. I talked mostly with Alice, Brad, Nancy, and Jura about the Icelandic language and cultural differences (apparently "Santa" doesn't exist in Iceland), and about school shootings and gun control in the US, about the Great British Bakeoff (which Nancy is a HUGE fan of), about The Office (show) which Alice insisted that the UK has a better version of, and about other places to travel to. Brad also talked about how he was from Maryland and Nancy was from Pennsylvania, and they met in a bar in Pennsylvania. I wondered if I would ever feel normal in a bar, ever. Nancy said she used to live so close to the Penn/Maryland border that she was able to walk over.</p>
<p>After all that, most of the group went bacl to the hotel, but us four (Alice, Katie, Aimee and I) went to check out the rooftop lounge. Honestly... it was so jank, there was like a foot of snow covering EVERYTHING, and the area seemed only accessible by a thin spiral metal black staircase. It was so chilly and on our way back to the hotel, the wind and snow was so intense that snow was blowing horizontally across and whipping us in our faces. Alice didn't get a change to zip up her jacket, and we were literally being pushed back by the wind.</p>

<h3>Hótel Örk</h3>
<p>After we finally got back, we went to explore. The lobby is on floor 2, and we descended to floor 1, where we saw a bunch of youngish dudes sitting in the outdoor hot tub, and Katie deemed the lot to be frat boys having a party. They and I had wanted to go to take a dip, but didn't want to be around that group, so we just kept walking. We went to check out the women's changing room, and noticed heaps and heaps of towels! Aimee grabbed two and gave one to me, and we were going to use it for the Secret Lagoon (another hot springs) tomorrow. We snuck the towels and took another elevator, and actually ended up in the wrong part of the building, so we have to descend back to floor 2 and take a different clanky elevator to our rooms. On the way we actually ran into Brad and rode with him.</p>
<p>After we got back to our room, I had to go to the restroom for the longest time and then got ready for bed. Aimee unpacked stuff and we found a button on the hotel phone that would alert us anytime someone saw the Aurora Borealis! She also got to call her 1 year old nephew named Eddie, and her littlest brother Josh (who studied psychology and theatre), and I got to see Eddie on her facetime too, he's so adorable with his little cheeks! I messaged friends back while she called, and after that we ended up talking more even though she had barely any sleep (except for short naps) since Wednesday. She's also a doctor with a really demanding schedule, and we were talking about different spots we'd traveled to, and friends, family, work, etc. Aimee's middle bro is a financial advisor who's VERY busy, and she also helped her friend out before the trip with a very long overnight shift on top of her own stuff too. Serious props to her... that sounds like sleep deprivation to the max. I also brought up my ex in the context of a traveling partner, and I REALLY believe that traveling alone I can feel more connected to other folks, the land, and myself. It's been really fulfilling so far. Just hope we can really see the aurora sometime!</p>

<h2>Sunday - Feb 4, 2024</h2>
<p>Woke up throughout the night and tried to see if there was any chance of glimpsing the aurora but not, it was too cloudy. I woke up for longer at 5:30AM in Iceland time and messaged people back, then fell asleep until 9AM. Got ready and then went down with Aimee to get free breakfast at the hotel. They ran out of oatmeal, so I ate a lot of fruit, and two pieces of toast with strawberry and blueberry jam. I also snagged a small coffee and took it with me along with the toast-jam sandwich on the bus. We learned briefly about the native trees and education system in Iceland from Jura and the way to the Haukadalur Geothermal Area Geyser.</p>

<h3>Strokkur / Golden Circle</h3>
<p>We saw the Strokkur blow a couple times and they had intervals of 5-7 mins, but we also walked more and went to the giftshop where I picked up some local-made lava-themed and puffin-themed vegan soaps as souvenirs for friends. I also got a coffee and was late back to the bus because I thought everyone was still exploring.</p>

<h3>Hvita River</h3>
<p>We stopped at Gullfoss Falls and Jura didn't want to park around other vans so she suggested we reconvene at the lower parking lot. The falls were beautiful but it was so SO cold. Even taking our hands out of our gloves for a couple of seconds was a bit too rough. I stuck more with the group this time to avoid being separated. It was so cold that my eyelashes froze and ice started building on them. We tried to meet up back at the van but the stairs down were closed for safety. Aimee and a couple others messaged Jura and it turned out that the van got stuck in the snow! It was also the only vehicle in the lot, which was already a bad sign. Anyways, we stay in the gift shop/cafe for a while and I ended up buying a pullover and a little glass puffin gift. Aimee and I thought Katie and Alice went to try to help out Jura with the van, and we convened with the rest of the group. Brad also decided to try and get to the van by walking along the road. We didn't make it super far, and Brad and Annie wanted to turn back for safety. We walked back a third time along the falls trail to see what was happening with the van. Aimee walked back after a while, and I stayed behind with Brad to see what was going on with the van. We saw this durable-looking truck come along after a while, and the Intrepid van FINALLY starts moving. There was a couple in a yellow hummer looking vehicle that drives past BOTH trucks in the lower lot and didn't get stuck. Anyways, my eyelashes were all iced together, and we made our way back to the gift station and let the others know what we saw. Brad joked that we helpwd push the van out of the snow but Nancy saw right though the joking. After a bit, Jura came in and said we could board. I was going to get a vegan panini because I was starving but I didn't want to hold up the group, so we boarded and went to the next destination.</p>

<h3>Friðheimar</h3>
<p>We headed to the largest and oldest tomato farm in Iceland called <a href="https://fridheimar.is/en" target="_blank">Friðheimar</a> in Reykholt. The entire restaurant was COMBINED with the greenhouse, and it was just so spectacular with HUGE hanging tomato plants all vining to the massive glass greenhouse ceiling. I got a vegan green tomato apple pie, which was beautifully presented in flower pots. Katie got the same, and Aimee got the nonvegan version. Alice got this beautiful caprese thing with MASSIVE heirloom tomatoes, and this huge lump of mozzarella came with it. Heather got a super tasty tortilla thing that looked like a pizza, and Sally got a tomato icecream that she wanted everyone to try. It according to folks tasted a lot like cheesecake? I also ate a lot of free tasty spongy plain bread, and there was this delicious marinated cucumber spread with garlic oil and fresh basil. The basil could be cut/pinched off and was potted in a ceramic pot in the middle of our two tables.</p>
<p>After lunch we got a tour from one of the employees, and she said that the farm imported bees in order to pollinate the tomatoes. She also had a little tray sample with these super flavorful cherry tomatoes. Katie talked about why vegans don't eat honey, and it's because some beekeepers will snip the wings off of multiple queen bees and stuff them together, so that the worker bees (around 60 per queen) will be able to be controlled a lot easier. And specifically snipping the wings off queens is unethical because queens will try to escape but they can't, and in nature they don't get along with other queens. I had been avoiding honey on principle just because there's so many bees being used by humans, but I guess that's the main reason why most vegans ACTUALLY avoid honey.</p>

<h3>Flúðir</h3>
<p>After the tomato farm, we went to another springs called the Secret Lagoon which is Iceland's oldest natural geothermal swimming area. The shower facilities were very... unprivate. There were not even separators between each showerhead, and it felt awkward trying to change while keeping a towel stably wrapped. The actual pool area was a lot different from yesterday's Kreuma hot springs. It was a single pool this time with black rocks at the bottom, and it was super steamy with different patches of hotter/cooler areas around. The sunset glistening through the fogginess, and goofing off, and chilling with the group was so relaxing and fun, especially after all that coldness. Our hair strands and eyelashes started freezing up and becoming frosty too! Katie's hair literally looked like a bunch of white noodle strands, and she helped me shape mine into a unicorn horn, which Aimee snapped a photo of. Brad also shaped his hair into spikes and Mo took a bunch of photos while Fara was laughing at all of us. After a while we all got out, got back on the bus, and went to the hotel.</p>
<div class="gallery col2"><figure><img alt="Fludir Secret Lagoon" src="./images/2024/2024-2-reykjavik/2-4-fludir.jpg"></figure></div>
<p>On the bus back, I listened again to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/616yEEd2w2dBiHk2P6Y6H8?si=d9c3979be5a94522" target="_blank">Swimmers</a>. It's just such an emotional, growing, almost-haunting, yet melancholy song. And it made me feel small and hidden and immersed in the snowy tundra, just lost in Iceland so far from home.</p>

<h3>Hveragerdi</h3>
<p>After we got back, we showered and got THOROUGHLY clean (because the showers at the Secret Lagoon were just not as good as Kreuma's), and Aimee and I met everyone down at the breakfast area. If Aimee didn't check the break</p>
<p>Northern Lights</p>

<h2>Wednesday - Feb 7, 2024</h2>
<h3>AirBnB</h3>
<p>Public swimming pool Vesturbæjarlaug, Hófsvallagata. It was still dark when I got there and I watched the sun go up while I marinated in the pool. It felt so nice, and I got to rest in the shallow area where the water covers most of your body but you can lay in a way that your head is above the water.</p>

<h3>Cat Cafe</h3>
<p>Went to <a href="https://kattakaffihusid.is" target="_blank">Kattakaffihúsið</a> which was still in Reykjavík. I got breakfast and pet lots of cute cats. I also journaled in my notebook, and there was another girl there who was also journaling. We wound up talking after we were admiring one of the cats, and her name is unique so I'll call her Anna. We talked about travel, and she was in Iceland by herself, and not with a tour group.</p>
<p>Walked around the city.</p>

<h3>KEF Boarding</h3>
<p>Hung out with Anna until they announced my gate. She's from Homer, Alaska and she's also a pilot! We wandered around and explored the terminals a bit, and she got to try Iceland's famous hot dog stand too (there was one in the airport). We were standing in line for her flight to JFK Airport.</p>
<p>When I got to my gate I had to do the passport validation thing again, and they asked if I wanted to check my bags for early boarding. I said yes, and they put a sticker on my duffel. But... I didn't know where to stick my duffel for the checked bags so I just... hung onto it? And preborded anyways?? And they let me! I mean... no one stopped me.</p>

<h3>SEA Boarding</h3>
<p>I bought this overpriced impossible burger with tater tots after arriving, but got it because I was starving! $16 for a pathetic burger (literally buns around the size of my palm, with 2-3 slices of pickles and a patty) and super greasy tots... there was no sauce either because the sauce that came with wasn't vegan. Oh well... after eating it with some ketchup and mustard I felt like I was gonna be sick, but I just couldn't finish the tots. They were playing the WORST song I've ever heard after entering the food hub area of the Seattle layover. It was legitimately awful, I tried to ask Google to see what it was but no dice... What a layover. I finally went to the gate after 2h, and boarded. On the plane I was sat in a window seat, and the row was actually full. There was a guy seated next to me in the middle (he looked a bit uncomfortable), and a vocal older lady who was in the aisle. It was a 50-ish minute flight and I slept nearly the whole way to PDX. Just put down the tray table right after takeoff, and napped on top of it.</p>

<h3>PDX</h3>
<p>When I finally arrived in PDX I ran as fast as possible out to where the bus station was, and lucky I did because I managed to board and JUST made it on (the bus left maybe 2 minutes later). Thought to myself that it was a good call I didn't check my duffel or anything, that would have been such a hassle waiting for it to come out, who knows if I could have made this bus or not, and would have had to wait another hour for the next bus to arrive. Rode a while until I was at the transit center station, and then had to wait 15 minutes for bus 15 to let people on board. Then after riding 40+ stops I accidentally got off a stop in advance, so I had to walk extra to get home. IT was so nice FINALLY taking my mask off, the hard plastic edges cut into my face likely while I was napping, and it stung. But the fresh air was nice and I made my way back. Then at the entrance to my apartment building, I realized that I'd fucked up and forgot my building fob. THE BUILDING FOB. Which I'd taken off my keychain so I wouldn't lose it. What an idiotic move! It was just past 10PM PDX time then, and I was so exhausted. I messaged my neighbors but they didn't respond, which made sense... it was so late. I tried to buzz myself in but my name didn't show up on the building directory... so I have to talk to management about that too. Felt really resigned and thought it wouldn't be the end of the world if I slept outside, after all, Iceland was a LOT colder than Portland. But after another maybe 15 minutes, this guy in a blue workvest passes by the doors and I run up fast and knock on the glass to get his attention, he lets me in after (slightly suspiciously) asking what unit I'm in and he looks like some kind of deliveryperson. I felt bad, and was so thankful I almost cried. I finally got back, my safe space, my home. I showered, did a bit of laundry, slept in my own bed, and was out like a rock.</p>

<h2>Songs</h3>
<p>These songs were really core to my experience in Iceland. The music looking out at the snow blowing horizontally across the road, looking up at the stars while in a hot springs, the cold airy vocals really matched the vibe. Specifically, I will never not think of Southwestern Iceland when coming across "Swimmers" by Andrew Belle.</p>
