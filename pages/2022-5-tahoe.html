<h3>Pleasanton</h3>
<p>Farmer's Market, Strawberry plants</p>

<h3>Whole Earth Festival and Davis</h3>
<p>After driving from Pleasanton, I parked next to the Mondavi Center in Davis. It was strange, and felt as though I'd never really left. How many of those students were just touring the campus? How many were alumni? Do the students think of Davis as truly a home?</p>
<p>The festival was all laid out in the Quad, and there were so many people, and many weren't masked at all. It was so crowded towards the middle, that there was barely room to step. I looped around the stalls until I found Corvidopolis, which is run by a guy who draws mushrooms, and happens to be based in Corvallis. I got some clothing with mushroom prints and two stickers, and the artist gave me more stickers for free.</p>
<p>After that, I got a Patch Burger at Burger Patch, which was a vegan burger place. I also got a Thai boba milk tea from Teaspoon, and Sweet and Shavery's Sunset shaved ice and soft serve combo for the journey up.</p>

<h3>Lake Hogan Campground</h3>
<p>Car setup, Stuff They Don't Want You To Know, Hamilton's Pharmacopia, campfire S'mores, Shooting star.</p>

<h3>Lake Hogan Campground</h3>
<p>Gross Bathroom</p>

<h3>Black Chasm Caverns National Landmark</h3>
<p>Screaming baby, cave bacon</p>

<h3>Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park</h3>
<p>North Loop Trail</p>

<h3>Toiyabe National Forest</h3>
<p>Snow chains, blizzard</p>

<h3>South Lake Tahoe</h3>
<p>Cuppa Tahoe, mushroom books</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>After arriving at the AirBnB, I looked around the entrance. Drove into the sloped driveway and tested out all the door codes. It's a really charming thing, with warm wood framing, trees all around, and heating set to a warm 68°F. I left to get food soon after.</p>

<h3>Heavenly Village</h3>
<p>Slice of Sierra Pizza and Big Will</p>
<p>I was totally planning to drive to Nevada to get gas, but thought it best to head back. I ended up re-putting on the snow chains.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>After work I shoveled snow out from the Subie. The warmth after yesterday's driving must have melted much of the compressed snow into ice. There was an insane amount of ice beneath it, all crusted up and a quarter-inch thick at least. I'm glad that was taken care of today because if that ice built up, then the Subie might actually get stuck.</p>

<h3>Freel Perk Cafe</h3>
<p>Initially I just wanted to go to The Divided Sky, which the AirBnB host recommended. I got a caprese, which I thought was a sandwich, but in fact was a cold salad-- not something too appetizing in the cold. So I started walking back and saw that <a href="https://www.freelperkcafe.com" target="_blank">Freel Perk Cafe</a> was on the way. At the entrance, there was a Rose White Chocolate Mocha being advertised as one of the specials. After ordering that and waiting on a toasted asiago salmon bagel, I took a sip (with whipped cream) and it was so SO cozy. I think it might have been the best mocha I've ever had. The rose syrup they use is really unique, and with the cold and snow that was going on outside, it was seriously the best drink at the best time. On the way back I also stopped in <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-market-south-lake-tahoe-2" target="_blank">Holiday Market</a> for ciabatta rolls made in Truckee, and truffle goat cheese from Sonoma County.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>It's really dry in Sitka cabin. My eyes started hurting from staring at the screen, and I slept late last night to code and call Sam. But waking up from my alarm and being able to do things on my schedule is really nice. It was bright and quite sunny earlier in the day, but it started snowing again starting at 11AM. Maybe tomorrow will have kinder weather, and I'll be able to properly see Lake Tahoe! For brunch I had the same sandwich setup as yesterday, and finished the salad. There are 3 ciabatta rolls left.</p>
<p>I went outside and shoveled a bit of snow away from the Subie, tried to gauge if I would go back to Freel Perk again. I was planning on returning to get that sweet sweet mocha again... but there's about half a foot of snow <em>everywhere</em>, and I didn't want to walk over a mile again, especially because there's way more snow than yesterday. Instead, I took a plate out, balled up some snowballs, and poured some soda and lemon juice on them. The snowballs were really tasty! Just wish I'd remembered to grab maple syrup yesterday at Holiday Market.</p>
<p>Just been listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rZp7G3gIH6WkyeXbrZnGi?si=zc4_DN69SLOaXmohNGAEVQ" target="_blank">Novo Amor</a> and looking out the window, coding and trying not to think about work. A fox trotted a distance away from the window across the property through the snow, which was really neat to see. I've got another meeting tomorrow for a company project, yet I can't seem to keep my mind off of it... I think I'll work a bit on it tonight and finish the rest tomorrow morning.</p>

<h2>Wednesday — May 11, 2022</h2>
<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>Woke at 6:00AM to finish the work project. It was thankfully a quick meeting and I resolved a major bug barely a minute before the meeting started. Never want to have that close of a call again.</p>

<h3>Carson City, NV</h3>
<p>Kojo and the Eyepatch Gentleman</p>

<h3>Incline Village, NV</h3>
<p>Santa's Workshop</p>

<h3>Tahoe City, CA</h3>
<p>I drove through Tahoe City and got some very pungent No Name pasta and caramelized lemon brussel sprouts at Za's Lakefront Restaurant. It was very delicious but I worried that it would attract bears.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>Sitca Cabin is a shared rental, and yesterday evening someone else arrived to stay in the room across from mine. I met her this morning and her name is Audrey. She seems nice and has an accent that could be northern European, and she was in the kitchen making breakfast. It wasn't as scary as I thought meeting her, but don't know if I'll ever get over the nervousness of interacting with unfamiliar people. I also took a few short naps, since I woke up at 5:00AM.</p>

<h3>Truckee</h3>
<p>After work, drove to Truckee to try and find food. Downtown Truckee was quite small, but after paying $2.33 for parking I started walking through and exploring. I came across <a href="https://thesockparlour.com" target="_blank">The Sock Parlour</a>, which sold mushroom books, socks, clothes, and merchandise! I got a pair of mushroom socks for Sam, and a mushroom shirt and a deck of mushroom cards.</p>
<p>After that, I kept walking trying to find food, but couldn't really find anything. It wasn't so late, just after 5PM, but most shops weren't open at all or had just closed their doors. I walked into a candy shop and it seemed like the lady was outwardly friendly, but after a bit it felt like she just wanted me gone since I took an extra minute to ponder what to order. I felt awkward and as I left said "nothing for me today" and she said, "maybe next time!" knowing full well that we'd probably never see each other again.</p>
<p>It was for the best that I didn't get anything at the candy shop, because the next place I entered was <a href="https://coffeebar.square.site" target="_blank">Coffeebar</a>, where I got the most amazing Lavender Latte with oat milk. There was this thick whipped foam on the top of the latte, and there were tiny specks of lavender petals on top of the foam. The coffee was silky smooth and creamy. If Freel Perk has the best mocha, Coffeebar by far has the best latte. The cashier lady had the warmest smile, and I wondered if any of the customers thought of her as their favorite cashier.</p>

<h3>Northstar Village</h3>
<p>Rubicon Pizza, White Rabbit Tea, Frederic kitty. Parking lot and Tahoe sunset.</p>

<h2>Friday — May 13, 2022</h2>
<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>I packed up my duffel and everything, and tidied up the room. As I walked out to the Subie, I noticed dirt along the driver's side, and I realized there was a distinct paw print on the side. <em>A bear had been right next to the Subie.</em> I thought it could have wanted to break in, since I left an empty coffee cup in the front cupholder, and even though bears don't drink coffee (usually), their extraordinary sense of smell could definitely have led it to the Subie.</p>
<h3>Emerald Bay State Park</h3>
<p>Eagle Falls, vista point. Past bridge, snow. Rocks. Bluejays. Sat and meditated while looking at falls. Tried my coworker's meditation technique. Opened my eyes and felt more peaceful, started crying for some reason, partially because the falls were so beautiful, but also because I felt thankful that nature wouldn't ever judge what I said or how I present myself, because it literally does not and cannot give a shit if I exist however I exist.</p>
<p>Hiked back and went on a second trail called Vikingsholm. Mrs. Knight and her stone house on the inly idland of Lake Tahoe.</p>
<h3>Campground By the Lake</h3>
<p>Biscuit and bikes, snow cone. mushroom</p>
<p>Walked to Azul all the way from the campsite. There I got a sweet potato taco which was amazing, and a cucumber salad which was really  good too, but I spilt some of the vinegar juice on my hands, jeans, and backpack. And then on the way back I went to Sno-Flake Drive-In. I got a strawberry shake because I felt like it, which tasted delicious, and I started walking along the lake again. But something didn't agree with my stomach. The campsite itself was not very memorable setting because I vomited up a milkshake and went to sleep early. It sounds melodramatic, but paranoid thoughts started up since I was alone. It triggered a mini panic attack and I thought if I died there, then my parents would be so sad. My brother would be so sad. The last thing I'd tried to do was run away from them, going on adventures wuite far away, to assert my independence and feel some kind of validation that I could be my own person without them. But I love them and I never really wanted to leave them, I just wanted them to be supportive and not judge me for living unconventionally, and to prove to them that I have control over my own life and choices. And Sam would be so sad and I'd never get to hold his hand again, and I thought about the little moments and started to feel really bad. And my SoCal friend would never even know what happened, until my brother told her.</p>
<p>I started crying again, but not because it was a good cry. Just a girl, dead in her car, because of a stupid craving. I don't want to die. That was the one time I didn't know if I'd make it out ok, but I thought as long as I kept breathing I'd be fine. Then I started rocking back and forth to make myself feel better and to stimulate my breathing, but I thought, oh shoot, what if the other campers see my car moving, and wanted to check it out? I didn't want to incur some crazy-ass medical bill, or get kicked out of the campsite, so I just drank a lot of water, and eventually fell asleep.</p>

<h3>Campground By the Lake</h3>
<p>Woke up at 7:00AM and felt significantly better than yesterday, but was still awfully groggy. Since I emptied my guts in the subie (mostly into an empty water container that was luckily kept). Took some time to clean up and left the campsite as soon as possible. I felt ashamed and like I overreacted yesterday, but being in an unfamiliar place where health was a concern was really scary.</p>
<p>Ended up driving to a nearby Rite Aid to pick up some Tide pods and an air freshener, and sunscreen. Then drove to Tahoe Keys Laundromat to wash and dry everything. Got some change from a $5, and the dryer wouldn't dry too well so I put it in for 5 min, then 5 more, then finally 15. I think the washer didn't do that great of a job either but it is what it is. I also got gas for $5.77/gal at Amerigas in South Tahoe, which was pretty extraordinary since the place down the street was selling for $6+. On the border, the gas prices were $6.70+, it was crazy high.</p>
<h3>Markleeville and Woodfords</h3>
<p>Breakfast Taco, Caf</p>
<h3>Gardnerville, NV</h3>
<p>Kim's Teahouse, honeydew ice. In Nevada I finally had signal so I texted my parents, Sam, and my SoCal friend since I couldn't yesterday. I also wanted to go to Genoa but it was just a tad too far, and wanted to return to the first-come-first-serve campground before anyone else arrived.</p>
<h3>Kit Carson Campground</h3>
<p>Mini hike around river. Bear statues. Golden-umber water, closed general store.</p>
<p>I completely read the <a href="https://www.acornnaturalists.com/familiar-mushrooms-national-audubon-societyr-pocket-guide.html" target="_blank">National Audubon Society Pocket Guide's Familiar Mushrooms</a> book (which was meant for Sam's friend), and two chapters of <a href="https://www.dougbierend.com/IN-SEARCH-OF-MYCOTOPIA" target="_blank">In Search of Mycotopia</a> by Doug Bierend, and then it started getting dark. I set up the Subie and actually used the insect windowshield meshes that I'd got since bugs were pretty prolific there.</p>
