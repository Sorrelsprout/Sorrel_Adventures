<h3>Pleasanton</h3>
<p>Farmer's Market, Strawberry plants</p>

<h3>Whole Earth Festival and Davis</h3>
<p>After driving from Pleasanton, I parked next to the Mondavi Center in Davis. It was strange, and felt as though I'd never really left. How many of those students were just touring the campus? How many were alumni? Do the students think of Davis as truly a home?</p>
<p>The festival was all laid out in the Quad, and there were so many people, and many weren't masked at all. It was so crowded towards the middle, that there was barely room to step. I looped around the stalls until I found Corvidopolis, which is run by a guy who draws mushrooms, and happens to be based in Corvallis. I got some clothing with mushroom prints and two stickers, and the artist gave me more stickers for free.</p>
<p>After that, I got a Patch Burger at Burger Patch, which was a vegan burger place. I also got a Thai boba milk tea from Teaspoon, and Sweet and Shavery's Sunset shaved ice and soft serve combo for the journey up.</p>

<h3>Lake Hogan Campground</h3>
<p>Car setup, Stuff They Don't Want You To Know, Hamilton's Pharmacopia, campfire S'mores</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>After arriving at the AirBnB, I looked around the entrance. Drove into the sloped driveway and tested out all the door codes. It's a really charming thing, with warm wood framing, trees all around, and heating set to a warm 68°F. I left to get food soon after.</p>

<h3>Heavenly Village</h3>
<p>Sierra Slices and Big Will</p>
<p>I was totally planning to drive to Nevada to get gas, but thought it best to head back. I ended up re-putting on the snow chains.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>After work I shoveled snow out from the Subie. The warmth after yesterday's driving must have melted much of the compressed snow into ice. There was an insane amount of ice beneath it, all crusted up and a quarter-inch thick at least. I'm glad that was taken care of today because if that ice built up, then the Subie might actually get stuck.</p>

<h3>Freel Perk Cafe</h3>
<p>Initially I just wanted to go to The Divided Sky, which the AirBnB host recommended. I got a caprese, which I thought was a sandwich, but in fact was a cold salad-- not something too appetizing in the cold. So I started walking back and saw that <a href="https://www.freelperkcafe.com" target="_blank">Freel Perk Cafe</a> was on the way. At the entrance, there was a Rose White Chocolate Mocha being advertised as one of the specials. After ordering that and waiting on a toasted asiago salmon bagel, I took a sip (with whipped cream) and it was so SO cozy. I think it might have been the best mocha I've ever had. The rose syrup they use is really unique, and with the cold and snow that was going on outside, it was seriously the best drink at the best time. On the way back I also stopped in <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-market-south-lake-tahoe-2" target="_blank">Holiday Market</a> for ciabatta rolls made in Truckee, and truffle goat cheese from Sonoma County.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>It's really dry in Sitka cabin. My eyes started hurting from staring at the screen, and I slept late last night to code and call Sam. But waking up from my alarm and being able to do things on my schedule is really nice. It was bright and quite sunny earlier in the day, but it started snowing again starting at 11AM. Maybe tomorrow will have kinder weather, and I'll be able to properly see Lake Tahoe! For brunch I had the same sandwich setup as yesterday, and finished the salad. There are 3 ciabatta rolls left.</p>
<p>I went outside and shoveled a bit of snow away from the Subie, tried to gauge if I would go back to Freel Perk again. I was planning on returning to get that sweet sweet mocha again... but there's about half a foot of snow <em>everywhere</em>, and I didn't want to walk over a mile again, especially because there's way more snow than yesterday. Instead, I took a plate out, balled up some snowballs, and poured some soda and lemon juice on them. The snowballs were really tasty! Just wish I'd remembered to grab maple syrup yesterday at Holiday Market.</p>
<p>Just been listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rZp7G3gIH6WkyeXbrZnGi?si=zc4_DN69SLOaXmohNGAEVQ" target="_blank">Novo Amor</a> and looking out the window, coding and trying not to think about work. A fox trotted a distance away from the window across the property through the snow, which was really neat to see. I've got another meeting tomorrow for a company project, yet I can't seem to keep my mind off of it... I think I'll work a bit on it tonight and finish the rest tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>I drove through Tahoe City and got some very pungent No Name pasta and caramelized lemon brussel sprouts at Za's Lakefront Restaurant. It was very delicious but I worried that it would attract bears.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>Sitca Cabin is a shared rental, and yesterday evening someone else arrived to stay in the room across from mine. I met her this morning and her name is Audrey. She seems nice and has an accent that could be northern European, and she was in the kitchen making breakfast. It wasn't as scary as I thought meeting her, but don't know if I'll ever get over the nervousness of interacting with unfamiliar people.</p>
