<h3>On the Road</h3>
<p>Sam's phone's charging port wasn't working properly and it took a while to reshape a bent metal piece on the inside. I used the tweezers on my pocket knife but accidentally dropped them between the seats... they're lost forever now. Afterwards it was a lot easier to charge the phone, but my hands started shaking from hunger. Sam suggested we go to Dunkin Donuts, and we got a box of 12! There were a LOT of donuts and we engulfed about half. We also got some pumpkin coffees and hit the road again.</p>

<h2>Friday — Sep 9, 2022</h2>
<h3>Portland</h3>
<p>Breakfast at hotel, In J Coffee at PS with dragon mural, Lady wanted directions to OSHU, Marquam nature park. Long meeting, Walked through Goose Hollow and saw a very quaint house overgrown with plants, and went to Harlow for vegan mac and cheese, durian salad, and two thick fruit and veggie smoothies. Kept walking Rose garden. I thought the San Jose Rose Garden was expansive, but the Portland one was something else! So many different flower varieties, rows upon rows of flowers. It was probably 3 or more times the size of San Jose's. We arrived right around sundown, and we really went at a spectacular time of year... everything was in bloom. Almost to Hoyt Arboretum but it was too dark and I was tired and really wanted to head back.</p>

<p>Bison Coffeehouse was really neat, it was a small but crowded cozy space. People worked on their laptops and there were two chairs made of deer pelts for the seating. I was contemplating sitting while Sam used the restroom, but sitting on dead deer hide didn't seem quite right to me, especially since the wood framing of the chairs looked very ornate, and one of them looked like it was meant for toddlers.</p>
<p>The Grotto</p>
<p>The Witch's Castle was also super cool. The hazy light-orangey skies added to the experience. Sam's friend<span style="display:none;"> R from college</span>, Food trucks. Dispersed camping</p>

<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>Fred Meyers, Starlink, Dogs. Dispersed campsite was free! There was a 14 day stay limit and we saw folks that definitely had been staying at their campsite for a long while (with furniture and chairs and crates all scattered around). We snagged the last campsite spot which was pretty close to the bathrooms, and saw a black car come in a while later while we were still setting up.</p>

<h2>Sunday — Sep 11, 2022</h2>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>After packing up we walked along the road until we saw an RV out in the distance, then decided to head back to the Subie, to start the long journey back to the bay. People passed by on trucks and it seemed like they lived in the area, and we also met a lady walking a very cute black labrador puppy named Riley. The puppy was a year old and was very excited by people.</p>
