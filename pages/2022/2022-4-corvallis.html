<h3>HackDavis</h3>
<p>HackDavis is this Saturday and Sunday, and Sam and I decided to volunteer as mentors and judges, with the plan to then keep heading north to Corvallis and Eugene then loop back in a week's time. I drove to PTown to pick Sam up way early in the morning and then we set off to Davis. It's been so long since going to Davis, I almost forgot the familiarity of the ARC and the bike roads all around. And inside the ARC Pavilion (which was renamed), the blue stadium bleachers all tucked away vertically, just like they had been a couple years ago.</p>
<p>We checked in and helped around a bit. It was really interesting meeting the students. And even more interesting seeing everyone masked to keep safe, tables a slightly sparser. After helping some students we walked around campus for a bit. Walked by the Student Community Center, which had basically been my second home. I remembered the in-between-class naps in the upstairs computer lab corridor, right next to an outlet where I could charge my phone. We exited through the SCC and headed towards the Physics building. Sam reminisced about Bainer hall and the Student Startup Center, and we tried to go in but it was locked.</p>
<p>Then we headed back and started mentoring more students. I helped out a designer who was working on a very intricate-looking project and needed help with Figma. There was another guy who needed HTML/CSS help, and I basically bounced between those two for most of the afternoon/evening. It felt... really good to help students out. I was them before, coding away and grinding through the night. It was exciting to see so many people working on so many cool projects.</p>
<p>Sam was able to meet up with his coworkers and we had dinner with one of them. He had a really robust-looking mask that was all pink and colorful, and we talked for a bit before going back to help some folks. I couldn't stay too long awake so headed back to the car to sleep, and Sam talked with his coworkers some more before car camping for the night too. The only time I've ever car-camped at Davis, and not been as worried to get ticketed by TAPS, yet I was still worried a lot because Sam didn't come to the car until REALLY late, even though we had a long drive the next day. In hindsight I wonder if he drank then. In hindsight everything is tinted with doubt.</p>

<h3>HackDavis</h3>
<p>We woke up and went to HackDavis again for the last bit. We didn't get to stay for judging because we really needed to take off.</p>

<h3>Brookings</h3>
<p>When we got to the campsite there were a lot of people already there! We found a nice place and set everything up though, but it was tiring because we got there so late.</p>

<h2>Monday — Apr 18, 2022</h2>
<h3>Brookings</h3>
<p>Campground. Beach with seastars, some kind of Pacific orange sea slug, octopus.</p>

<h3>Gold Beach</h3>
<p>Coastal Cups coffee house. We worked from there remotely, for a full workday! Just sat there through meetings and projects. The drinks were good though, and it pwas pouring outside, so it felt cozy indoors.</p>

<h3>Corvallis</h3>
<p>We got there in the evening, and as we drove into Corvallis, the darkened fields around the city were the same as when my mom used to drive from Oregon to California. It made me cry and I'm still not fully certain why. I think it was just because I remembered that scenario so long ago, though a different time of day but the same fields, sitting as a passenger looking outside at the same scene across all that time.</p>

<h3>Corvallis and OSU</h3>
<p>Bacon Salad, we purposely asked for no bacon yet they STILL put bacon in it. What a disappointment. I cried and Sam helped me pick out the bacon bits piece by piece.</p>

<h3>Eugene and UO</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Avery Park</h3>
<p>Train.</p>

<h3>Peavy Arboretum</h3>
<p>Darkened. Sam had a long call with his cofounder basically the entire time we were in the park and I didn't feel like we could fully immerse ourselves at the Arboretum, which I had wanted to explore for so long. There were some cool mushrooms though, so I snapped a lot of photos while we walked and he talked. I wanted to respect his call but I wanted to experience the park together... it was getting dark and stormy, and I just kept getting more and more worried since we weren't familiar with the park.</p>

<h3>Molly's Place</h3>
<p>We stayed in an AirBnB called Molly's Place in Springfield, next to Eugene. It was a charming in-law suite with quilted bed covers and a kitchen with tons of spices + herbs.</p>
<p>We had also gone to Market of Choice to pick up some duck-shaped cupcakes and snacks.</p>

<h3>UO</h3>
<p>Driving down. Western Skunk Cabbage. Darkened roads.</p>

<h3>Lava Beds Camping</h3>
<p>When we finally got to the campsite we had to pay for a spot. The price was something odd and Sam was digging through his jacket to find loose coins. We ended up finding out they were stuck inside the lining of his jacket and had entered through a hole in his pocket! We spent like 40 minutes trying to get the coins out of his pocket and we ended up getting some, but there were still quite a few left. Then when we tried to pay, all the coins couldn't fit through the payment slot! Everything was so comical and I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity. After we FINALLY got settled, we ended up having a deep talk and made a campfire. Though thoroughly exhausted, the chill desert with the flickering flames was beautiful.</p>

<h3>Lava Beds</h3>
<p>We saw some Petroglyphs! We also walked through some caves. In the daytime it was a lot warmer.</p>
<p>We also left the duck cupcakes in the heat of the car right under the front windshield, and the ducks melted! It was so ridiculously comical how they looked.</p>

<h3>Lassen Camping</h3>
<p>We arrived at night an parked in the central parking lot. It was a bit worrying because there wasn't a lot of instruction for where to pay, but we managed to get settled and found a spot not too far away from the visitor center. There was snow everywhere and the snowfall was like a wall twice our height next to the Subie! We went for a mini walk, testing out what the trail would be like. It was so cold, but once we started moving it was a bit more bearable. The stars though!</p>
<p>There were so many, it was stunning! I think the Tolkan Campground last year was still #1 though, but oh MAN was it beautiful. We looked through the binoculars at the stars and took a short walk towards where we entered the parking lot. Going to sleep car camping though, it was warm and very cozy, and I felt peaceful.</p>

<h3>Lassen National Park</h3>
<p>Snowball energy drinks. Equations. Sulfur pools. Bright snow. Sunglasses.</p>

<h3>Oakland (Homeroom)</h3>
<p>Elote Mac and Truffle Mac. I dropped Sam off in PTown and headed back to the South Bay. I didn't really want to go back, this was a fun adventure.</p>
