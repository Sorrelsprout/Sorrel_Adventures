<h3>HackDavis</h3>
<p>HackDavis is this Saturday and Sunday, and Sam and I decided to volunteer as mentors and judges, with the plan to then keep heading north to Corvallis and Eugene then loop back in a week's time. I drove to PTown to pick Sam up way early in the morning and then we set off to Davis. It's been so long since going to Davis, I almost forgot the familiarity of the ARC and the bike roads all around. And inside the ARC Pavilion (which was renamed), the blue stadium bleachers all tucked away vertically, just like they had been a couple years ago.</p>
<p>We checked in and helped around a bit. It was really interesting meeting the students. And even more interesting seeing everyone masked to keep safe, tables a slightly sparser. After helping some students we walked around campus for a bit. Walked by the Student Community Center, which had basically been my second home. I remembered the in-between-class naps in the upstairs computer lab corridor, right next to an outlet where I could charge my phone. We exited through the SCC and headed towards the Physics building. Sam reminisced about Bainer hall and the Student Startup Center, and we tried to go in but it was locked.</p>
<p>Then we headed back and started mentoring more students. I helped out a designer who was working on a very intricate-looking project and needed help with Figma. There was another guy who needed HTML/CSS help, and I basically bounced between those two for most of the afternoon/evening. It felt... really good to help students out. I was them before, coding away and grinding through the night. It was exciting to see so many people working on so many cool projects.</p>
<p>Sam was able to meet up with his coworkers and we had dinner with one of them. He had a really robust-looking mask that was all pink and colorful, and we talked for a bit before going back to help some folks. I couldn't stay too long awake so headed back to the car to sleep, and Sam talked with his coworkers some more before car camping for the night too. The only time I've ever car-camped at Davis, and not been as worried to get ticketed by TAPS.</p>

<p>We got there in the evening, and as we drove into Corvallis, the darkened fields around the city were the same as when my mom used to drive from Oregon to California. It made me cry and I'm still not sure why.</p>

<h3>Lassen Camping</h3>
<p>We arrived at night an parked in the central parking lot. It was a bit worrying because there wasn't a lot of instruction for where to pay, but we managed to get settled and found a spot not too far away from the visitor center. There was snow everywhere and the snowfall was like a wall twice our height next to the Subie! We went for a mini walk, testing out what the trail would be like. It was so cold, but once we started moving it was a bit more bearable. The stars though!<br>
    
<br>There were so many, it was stunning! I think Tolkan Campground was still #1 though, but oh MAN was it beautiful. We looked through the binoculars at the stars and took a short walk towards where we entered the parking lot.<br>

<br>Going to sleep car camping though, it was warm and very cozy, and I felt peaceful.</p>
