<h2>Saturday — May 7, 2022</h2>
<h3>Whole Earth Festival and Davis</h3>
<p>After driving from Pleasanton, I parked next to the Mondavi Center in Davis. It was strange, and felt as though I'd never really left, even if some of the buildings were renovated. Especially <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/renovated-walker-hall-opens-graduate-students-undergrads" target="_blank">Walker Hall</a>, which now looks so different, and I've never actually even been inside before either. How many of those students were just touring the campus? How many were alumni? Do the students think of Davis as truly a home?</p>
<p>The festival was all laid out in the Quad, and there were so many people, and many weren't masked at all. It was so crowded towards the middle, that there was barely room to step. I looped around the stalls until I found Corvidopolis, which is run by a guy who draws mushrooms, and happens to be based in Corvallis. I got some clothing with mushroom prints and two stickers, and the artist gave me more stickers for free.</p>
<p>After that, I got a Patch Burger at Burger Patch, which was a vegan burger place. I also got a Thai boba milk tea from Teaspoon, and Sweet and Shavery's Sunset shaved ice and soft serve combo for the journey up. It was nice to load up with a hefty meal and set off.</p>

<h3>Lake Hogan Campground</h3> 
<p>Car setup. I listened to the podcast Stuff They Don't Want You To Know, and also Hamilton's Pharmacopia. Took a walk along Lake Hogan and made a campfire, then ate some S'mores. There were so many crickets (or other insects) chirping, it was so serene. It was a really clear night and I saw a hhooting star.</p>

<h3>Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park</h3>
<p>Went to check out the <a href="https://chawse.org/park" target="_blank">Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park</a>. I started at the Info Center because I was unsure about their hours, and ended up seeing a LOT of cool woven baskets and learning about the black oak acorn that natives (specifically the Miwok tribe) used for grains.</p>

<p>It was SO snowy and foggy. Couldn't see anything except some distance ahead, it was just all white, but the scenery is so spectacular with all the trees from the sides, from the bits I could see. Then the snowstorm REALLY started picking up. I was getting a little more worried because I couldn't see the cars ahead driving from the other direction. At 8000ft and climbing (and 12min away from the destination), I hadn't put on snow chains because I thought I didn't need them since the roads didn't look snowed over.</p>

</div>
<p>Before arriving at my destination, I tried to put on snow chains. While doing so a Caltrans truck actually pulled up next to me and said since I've got good tires and all-wheel drive, I didn't need snow chains. Apparently they let most Subarus pass, and so I took the snow chains off. In the time that it took to put them on and off, it got REALLY really blizzardy. It was freezing and the snow was literally blowing diagonally. After waiting out the thick of the storm I kept driving.</p>

<h3>South Lake Tahoe</h3>
<p>The first place I stayed at when I arrived was Cuppa Tahoe. I don't quite remember what drink I ordered but I also got a quiche. I had to use the restroom to go #2 urgently, so I ordered and went. They finished the drink really fast and I felt bad that they kept calling my name. After getting the food and to pass time, I looked around the store, which had many books, souveniers and toys. It reminded me of World Market, with the cards and how the shelves were set up. In their little bookstore area, they had mushroom books! I bought the book, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That_the_Rain_Promises_and_More..." target="_blank">All That the Rain Promises and More...</a>" by mycologist David Arora, which I kept. I also bought the "<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouseretail.com/book/?isbn=9780679729846" target="_blank">National Audubon Society Pocket Guide: Familiar Mushrooms</a>" which was for Sam's friend/coworker John, who used to have that book and was excited to receive it. I told him I'd read it first, and that Sam said he'd deliver it to him after I got back from the trip. It was a nice feeling that I could give a gift to a fellow fungi-admirer.</p>
<p>I also went to Slice of Sierra Pizza to get some pizza and there was a huge dog in there that wanted pets, named Big Will. He was massive and fluffy, and I could pet him a lot since the shop was practically empty. I just chilled inside while waiting because I wanted to hide from the snow. Felt a little self-conscious because I was the only one with a mask, and the few patrons that were in there looked at me funny when I walked in. But I got the pizza and chilled in the back of the subie eating and surrounded by silent snow. It was really pretty.</p>

<p>I was totally planning to drive to Nevada to get gas, but thought it best to head back. I ended up re-putting on the snow chains. After getting more food, I went to explore Heavenly Village.</p>

<p>Since it was so icy out, I thought to put on snow chains again. I knew CalFire said my tires were ok but I was still really worried. It took a really long time to do, because I had to drive over each chain and then loop it around. The chains themselves got so iced up and I had to jostle the ice out of them, and my fingers felt frozen. Eventually I got all of them on.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>I've never heard the subie make such noises, even though the snow chains were installed correctly and the tire pressure all looked fine, and it was only a few miles away from the destination. It was a blizzard driving back to South Tahoe, and I was going at a good 23 mph (speed limit was 40MPH), though had to slow extra slow sometimes. It was creepy driving in the dark with all the snow around, it looked endless. Like some kind of horror setting. I'd never seen SO much snow just right in front of me before, and couldn't see anything just a couple feet in front.</p>
<p>After arriving at the AirBnB, it was already dark. I looked around the entrance. Drove into the sloped driveway and tested out all the door codes. It's a really charming thing, with warm wood framing, trees all around, and heating set to a warm 68°F.</p>

<h2>Monday — May 9, 2022</h2>
<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>After work I shoveled snow out from the Subie. The warmth after yesterday's driving must have melted much of the compressed snow into ice. There was an insane amount of ice beneath it, all crusted up and a quarter-inch thick at least. I'm glad that was taken care of today because if that ice built up, then the Subie might actually get stuck. After I got all set up, I loaded a podcast by <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com">Darknet Diaries</a> that Sam recommended and then set off on foot.</p>

<h3>Freel Perk Cafe & Holiday Market</h3>
<p>Initially I just wanted to go to The Divided Sky, which the AirBnB host recommended. I got a caprese, which I thought was a sandwich, but in fact was a cold salad-- not something too appetizing in the cold. So I started walking back and saw that <a href="https://www.freelperkcafe.com" target="_blank">Freel Perk Cafe</a> was on the way. It was attached to a mexican restaruant which closed at 2PM (I just wanted food... everywhere closed so early.) At the entrance, there was a Rose White Chocolate Mocha being advertised as one of the specials. After ordering that and waiting on a toasted asiago salmon bagel, I took a sip (with whipped cream) and it was so SO cozy. I think it might have been the best mocha I've ever had. The rose syrup they use is really unique, and with the cold and snow that was going on outside, it was seriously the best drink at the best time.</p>

<p>On the way back I also stopped in <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-market-south-lake-tahoe-2" target="_blank">Holiday Market</a> for ciabatta rolls made in Truckee, and truffle goat cheese from Sonoma County. It was over a 30m walk back. I made a sandwich with part of the caprese and some pesto. I could examine the AirBnB more too, at the entrance area there's the kitchen and a TV mounted in the living room. I didn't spend much time there (usually in my assigned room). There's a light above the kitchen stovetop that just never turns off. Overall it's very quaint.</p>

<h2>Tuesday — May 10, 2022</h2>
<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>It's really dry in Sitka cabin. My eyes started hurting from staring at the screen, and I slept late last night to code and call Sam. But waking up from my alarm and being able to do things on my schedule is really nice. It was bright and quite sunny earlier in the day, but it started snowing again starting at 11AM. Maybe tomorrow will have kinder weather, and I'll be able to properly see Lake Tahoe! For brunch I had the same sandwich setup as yesterday, and finished the salad. There are 3 ciabatta rolls left.</p>

<p>I went outside and shoveled a bit of snow away from the Subie, tried to gauge if I would go back to Freel Perk again. I was planning on returning to get that sweet sweet mocha again... but there's about half a foot of snow <em>everywhere</em>, and I didn't want to walk over a mile again, especially because there's way more snow than yesterday. Instead, I took a plate out, balled up some snowballs, and poured some soda and lemon juice on them. The snowballs were really tasty! Just wish I'd remembered to grab maple syrup yesterday at Holiday Market.</p>

A fox trotted a distance away from the window across the property through the snow, which was really neat to see. I've got another meeting tomorrow for a company project, yet I can't seem to keep my mind off of it... I think I'll work a bit on it tonight and finish the rest tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3>Tahoe City, CA</h3>
<p>I drove through Tahoe City and got some really savory but pungent No Name Pasta and caramelized balsamic reduction glazed lemon brussel sprouts at Za's Lakefront Restaurant, both of which were incredible. It was very delicious but I worried that it would attract bears. The wait time was long though, but I had a glorious view of the lake right at Sunset. The clouds in the distance were absolutely massive and it looked real rainy where they were. </p>

<p>Sitca Cabin is a shared rental, and yesterday evening someone else arrived to stay in the room across from mine. I met her this morning and her name is Audrey. She seems nice and has an accent that could be northern European, and she was in the kitchen making breakfast. It wasn't as scary as I thought meeting her, but don't know if I'll ever get over the nervousness of interacting with unfamiliar people. I also took a few short naps, since I woke up at 5:00AM.</p>

<h3>Truckee</h3>
<p>After work, drove to Truckee to try and find food. Downtown Truckee was quite small, but after paying $2.33 for parking I started walking through and exploring. I came across <a href="https://thesockparlour.com" target="_blank">The Sock Parlour</a>, which sold mushroom books, socks, clothes, and merchandise! I got a pair of saucy mushroom socks (the mushrooms wore heels had butts on them) for Sam, and a mushroom shirt and a deck of mushroom cards. It was an interesting coincidence, because some of the shirts were from Corvidopolis too! I felt glad to have supported the artist in-person, but it was still cool to see his work so far away, along somewhat the same trip.</p>

<p>After that, I kept walking trying to find food, but couldn't really find anything. It wasn't so late, just after 5PM, but most shops weren't open at all or had just closed their doors. I walked into a candy shop and it seemed like the lady was outwardly friendly, but after a bit it felt like she just wanted me gone since I took an extra minute to ponder what to order. I felt awkward and as I left said "nothing for me today" and she said, "maybe next time!" knowing full well that we'd probably never see each other again.</p>
<p>It was for the best that I didn't get anything at the candy shop, because the next place I entered was <a href="https://coffeebar.square.site" target="_blank">Coffeebar</a>, where I got the most amazing Lavender Latte with oat milk. There was this thick whipped foam on the top of the latte, and there were tiny specks of lavender petals on top of the foam. The coffee was silky smooth and creamy. If Freel Perk has the best mocha, Coffeebar by far has the best latte. The cashier lady had the warmest smile, and I wondered if any of the customers thought of her as their favorite cashier.</p>

<h3>Northstar Village</h3>
<p>The parking lot was confusing to navigate, and it was weird that there wasn't anyone around and most everything was closed. I asked a shopkeep and they said that the season for mountain biking hadn't started yet, and that it would start next. Walking through Northstar I remembered going there with my ex. His grandpa has a cabin in Truckee, and he'd brought me along for a family outing there before. But I felt so free walking around and exploring it, even though nothing was open except for a few restaurants here and there. I walked around everywhere, even past a theater where I saw the movie "Ready Player One" for the first time. I can't believe I was IN TAHOE back then and spent time watching a MOVIE instead of enjoying nature and absorbing my surroundings.</p>

<p>Met a kitty called Frederic after getting my food from Rubicon Pizza. He was so friendly and I thought he was a house cat but after I was sitting and petting him for a while, one of the food staff came out to hand me my to-go order. They said that he just showed up one day and they made sure he was fed, and that he liked people. He is so cute. They also said that the season for mountain biking hadn't started yet, and that it would start next week.</p>

<h3>Sitka Cabin</h3>
<p>I packed up my duffel and everything, and tidied up the room. As I walked out to the Subie, I noticed dirt along the driver's side, and I realized there was a distinct paw print on the side. <em>A bear had been right next to the Subie.</em> I thought it could have wanted to break in, since I left an empty coffee cup in the front cupholder, and even though bears don't drink coffee (usually), their extraordinary sense of smell could definitely have led it to the Subie.</p>

<h3>Emerald Bay State Park</h3>
<p>Eagle Falls, vista point. Past bridge, snow. Rocks. Bluejays. Sat and meditated while looking at falls. Tried my coworker's meditation technique. Opened my eyes and felt more peaceful, started crying for some reason, partially because the falls were so beautiful, but also because I felt thankful that nature wouldn't ever judge what I said or how I present myself, because it literally does not and cannot give a shit if I exist however I exist.</p>

<p>Hiked back and went on a second trail called Vikingsholm. Mrs. Knight and her stone house on the only island of Lake Tahoe.</p>

<h3>Campground By the Lake</h3>
<p>I wanted to try to rent a bike to ride around Tahoe Lake, but I didn't want to rent one and then the shop close on me. In hindsight I probably should have, but I didn't. But in the bike shop I met a golden retriever named Biscuit, who was very cute. After that I decided to walk to the lake edge and saw there was a stand selling snow cones, so I got one. It wasn't good and I started feeling disgusted that I was ingesting so much artificial shit, and so I ate all the snow but left a lot of syrup when I tossed it.</p>

    </figure>
</div>
<p>Walked to Azul all the way from the campsite. There I got a sweet potato taco which was amazing, and a cucumber salad which was really good too, but I spilt some of the vinegar juice on my hands, jeans, and backpack. And then on the way back I went to Sno-Flake Drive-In. I got a strawberry shake because I felt like it, which tasted delicious, and I started walking along the lake again. But something didn't agree with my stomach. The campsite itself was not very memorable setting because I threw up a milkshake and went to sleep early. It sounds melodramatic, but paranoid thoughts started up since I was alone. It triggered a mini panic attack and I thought if I died there, then my parents would be so sad. My brother would be so sad. The last thing I'd tried to do was run away from them, going on adventures quite far away, to assert my independence and feel some kind of validation that I could be my own person without them. But I care for them and I never really wanted make them feel like I wanted to leave them, I just wanted them to be supportive and not judge me for living unconventionally, and to prove to them that I have control over my own life and choices. To be free for a bit of what happened in the past and to try and get more of that sense of independence. And I thought about Sam and started to feel really bad. And my best friend would never even know what happened, until my brother told her.</p>
<p>I started crying again, but not because it was a good cry. Just thought of a girl, dead in her car, because of a stupid craving. I didn't want to die there, I wanted to live. That was the one time I didn't know if I'd make it out ok, but I thought as long as I kept breathing I'd be fine. Then I started rocking back and forth to make myself feel better and to stimulate my breathing, but I thought, oh shoot, what if the other campers see my car moving, and wanted to check it out? I didn't want to incur some crazy-ass medical bill, or get kicked out of the campsite, so I just drank a lot of water, and eventually fell asleep.</p>

<h2>Saturday — May 14, 2022</h2>
<h3>Campground By the Lake</h3>
<p>Woke up at 7:00AM and felt significantly better than yesterday, but was still awfully groggy. Since I emptied my guts in the subie (mostly into an empty water container that was luckily kept). Took some time to clean up and left the campsite as soon as possible. I felt ashamed and like I overreacted yesterday, but being in an unfamiliar place where health was a concern was really scary, albeit self-induced.</p>
<p>Ended up driving to a nearby Rite Aid to pick up some Tide pods and an air freshener, and sunscreen. Then drove to Tahoe Keys Laundromat to wash and dry everything. Got some change from a $5, and the dryer wouldn't dry too well so I put it in for 5 min, then 5 more, then finally 15. I think the washer didn't do that great of a job either but it is what it is. I also got gas for $5.77/gal at Amerigas in South Tahoe, which was pretty extraordinary since the place down the street was selling for $6+. On the border, the gas prices were $6.70+, it was crazy high.</p>

<h3>Markleeville and Woodfords</h3>
<p>Breakfast Taco, Caf</p>

<h3>Gardnerville, NV</h3>
<p>Kim's Teahouse, honeydew ice. In Nevada I finally had signal so I texted my parents, Sam, and my SoCal friend since I couldn't yesterday. I also wanted to go to Genoa but it was just a tad too far, and wanted to return to the first-come-first-serve campground before anyone else arrived.</p>

<h3>Kit Carson Campground</h3>
<p>Mini hike around river. Bear statues. Golden-umber water, closed general store.</p>
<p>I completely read the <a href="https://www.acornnaturalists.com/familiar-mushrooms-national-audubon-societyr-pocket-guide.html" target="_blank">National Audubon Society Pocket Guide's Familiar Mushrooms</a> book, and two chapters of <a href="https://www.dougbierend.com/IN-SEARCH-OF-MYCOTOPIA" target="_blank">In Search of Mycotopia</a> by Doug Bierend, and then it started getting dark. I set up the Subie and actually used the insect windowshield meshes that I'd got since bugs were pretty prolific there.</p>

<h2>Sunday — May 15, 2022</h2>
<h3>Kit Carson Campground</h3>
<p>It was warm today. I got a nosebleed likely because it was so dry. I was ready but not ready to head back... it would have been nice to have a shower but I didn't want to leave a state of adventure, even temporarily.</p>

<h3>Stockton</h3>
<p>Met with my Industrial Design friend. Mall walking in 92-degree weather, saw mushroom socks and jewelry in Hot Topic but didn't get anything. Design frustrations. Dick's Sporting Goods swim vests. We went to Kung Fu Tea and played mancala while we waited. Then we walked to the University of the Pacific and swing on their hammocks.</p>

<h3>Pleasanton</h3>
<p>I drove to PTown and picked up Sam, then we went to SomiSomi. There just happened to be a blood moon eclipse happening, so we stayed a while to wait for it. We went to a parking lot and danced in front of Off-5th to Que Rico Boogaloo.</p>
<p>After driving back home, I gave my mom the Strawberry plant that Sam helped hang onto, and also gave my brother the gold keychain from the Black Chasm Caverns. They were really happy about them, and I felt less guilty that I'm not going to be around next week either. They didn't seem to miss me too much which made me feel relieved, so I'm going to keep going.</p>
