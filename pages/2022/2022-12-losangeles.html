<h3>Northridge, CA</h3>
<p>Tulsi Indian Eatery, thalis</p>

<h3>Hotel</h3>
<p>Wouldn't let us stay because they revised their prices and didn't communicate with the credit card company that I booked through. The hotel also wouldn't amend their prices and I felt like a Karen being really frustrated with the staff. There were no discounts offered even though they were very much the ones that messed up. I received no email from them nor from the credit card company, and we had to find another place to stay in an emergency. I didn't bring the foldable car bed, and Sam really came through and found a Hilton(?) hotel (which was last-minute and pricey) but at least we had a place to sleep for the night.</p>

<h3>Dockweiler State Beach</h3>
<p>The Ocean Cleanup at Ballona Creek</p>

<h3>Santa Monica Pier</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Jalan Jalan Imports</h3>
<p>Sam was looking on iNaturalist where he saw there were quite a few mushroom sightings for the Psilocybe genus. We found our way to Jalan Jalan imports where there were a LOT of outdoor furniture items made of carved stone, driftwood decor. We saw both cup fungi (Peziza sp.) and Psilocybe allenii, and there were SO MANY of them too! It was crazy, the wavy caps were so beautiful. Of course we didn't take any but I really wanted to survey them... until next time.</p>

<h3>Topanga AirBnB</h3>
<p>Getting to our AirBnB was really muddy, and I was worried that the Subie would get stuck in mud due to the moistness and incline of the ground. Our host was Dave and his place was literally a shack. There was hay around and it felt so rickety. We sprayed everything with antibacterial spray. The quilted covers seemed dirty and I was so scared of there being cockroaches or bedbugs, even though the revies of the place seemed ok. The worst part is the "bathroom" and "kitchen" areas. The kitchen was straight up outdoors without a door, the sink was filthy and so were the counters. It was like if somebody crappily custom-made counters and threw them outside. the floor of the kitchen was straight up dirt, like there was no distinction between "indoors" or "outdoors", and I even found a big mushroom (roughly the size of my palm) growing right outside the "kitchen." What was definitely worse was the "bathroom". There were leaves in the shower area and it just felt really grimy. I was scared of getting a UTI already but I just felt like I couldn't get clean if I used any of the facilities. Sam and I were talking about trying a YMCA membership just to shower and get clean, but in the end we decided not to.</p>

<h2>Tuesday — Dec 13, 2022</h2>

<p>We decided not to stay another night at Dave's Shack, and headed towards Nevada instead. Sam thought we should just go and then find a place to stay, and I agreed. The whole day we were hoping we could cancel the rest of the days for Dave's Shack.</p>

<h3>Porto's</h3>
<p>Sam and his folks had gone to Porto's before and he hyped it up. We got quite a few pastries there and it was really busy already. We then started driving, and started trying the goodies we got. But goodies they were not. The buns that we ordered turned out to be meat buns, and I had a few bites of it before realizing. It felt really wrong and I couldn't eat any more, and asked Sam to pull over into a rest stop/gas station area where I had to vomit. I just felt the shame and guilt of eating meat overwhelm me, and couldn't stop crying.</p>

<h3>Boulder City AirBnB</h3>
<p>The two hosts of the tiny home AirBnB that we stayed at are a couple that used to travel all around. It's a super charming home but to get to the loft bed, we had to use a scary ladder that didn't feel very stable. The loft bed had a tapestry that covered the slanted ceiling, and the tapestry had elephants with funny-looking eyes and flowers on it.</p>

<p>Exploring the campus. We went into one of the lecture halls and found a creepy little closet that spanned multiple floors. I snagged a pen from the lecturer's table and dropped it down the closet hole... and I didn't hear it drop.</p>

<p>We met up for dinner with one of my best friends from uni! I just saw her three months ago, but this time she could meet Sam too. We went to a spot that had multiple food options, and we got plantain cakes.</p>

<h3>Coffee</h3>

<h3>Lido Marina Village</h3>
<p>We had dunch at Malibu Lido Farm, and it was also reccomended by Sam because his family went and it was good. It was a lot bougier than expected and the portions weren't even enough to get full from even though it felt extremely costly. The waterfront view was nice but there were a bunch of people who felt like they were looking at us with nonfriendly expressions on their faces.</p>
