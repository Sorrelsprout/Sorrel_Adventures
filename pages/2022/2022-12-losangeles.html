<h3>Hotel</h3>
<p>Wouldn't let us stay because they revised their prices and didn't communicate with the credit card company that I booked through. The hotel also wouldn't amend their prices and I felt like a Karen being really frustrated with the staff. There were no discounts offered even though they were very much the ones that messed up. I received no email from them nor from the credit card company, and we had to find another place to stay in an emergency. I didn't bring the foldable car bed, and Sam really came through and found a Hilton(?) hotel (which was last-minute and pricey) but at least we had a place to sleep for the night.</p>

<h3>Beach Walking</h3>
<p>We explored Dockweiler State Beach and saw the Ocean Cleanup at Ballona Creek.</p>

<h3>Jalan Jalan Imports</h3>
<p>Sam was looking on iNaturalist where he saw there were quite a few mushroom sightings for the Psilocybe genus. We found our way to Jalan Jalan imports where there were a LOT of outdoor furniture items made of carved stone, driftwood decor. We saw both cup fungi (Peziza sp.) and Psilocybe allenii, and there were SO MANY of them too! It was crazy, the wavy caps were so beautiful. Of course we didn't take any but I really wanted to survey them... until next time.</p>
<p>Sam also found the song "Topanga Canyon" by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDh5okESRV4&ab_channel=JohnVincentIII" target="_blank">John Vincent III</a> which was a bop.</p>

<h3>Malibu Hindu Temple</h3>
<p>Under construction. Sam wanted to visit and show his folks, but we couldn't go in. It felt abandoned even though the architecture was pretty.</p>

<h3>Topanga AirBnB</h3>
<p>Getting to our AirBnB was really muddy, and I was worried that the Subie would get stuck in mud due to the moistness and incline of the ground. Our host was Dave and his place was literally a shack. There was hay around and it felt so rickety. Inside there was an awkward little sink in the corner, and it looked like everything was recycled/upcycled (the sink looked chipped/rusted). We sprayed everything with antibacterial spray. The quilted covers seemed dirty and I was so scared of there being cockroaches or bedbugs, even though the revies of the place seemed ok. The worst part is the "bathroom" and "kitchen" areas. The kitchen was straight up outdoors without a door, the sink was filthy and so were the counters. It was like if somebody crappily custom-made counters and threw them outside. the floor of the kitchen was straight up dirt, like there was no distinction between "indoors" or "outdoors", and I even found a big mushroom (roughly the size of my palm) growing right outside the "kitchen." What was definitely worse was the "bathroom". There were leaves in the shower area and it just felt really grimy. I was scared of getting a UTI already but I just felt like I couldn't get clean if I used any of the facilities. Sam and I were talking about trying a YMCA membership just to shower and get clean, but in the end we decided not to.</p>

<p>We woke up really early to work a partial day, and it was SO cold. The shack had barely any installation and we had to use this janky old heater to try and make everything warmer.</p>

<h2>Tuesday — Dec 13, 2022</h2>

<p>We decided not to stay another night at Dave's Shack, and headed towards Nevada instead. Sam thought we should just go and then find a place to stay, and I agreed. The whole day we were hoping we could cancel the rest of the days for Dave's Shack.</p>

<h3>Porto's</h3>
<p>Sam and his folks had gone to Porto's before and he hyped it up. We got quite a few pastries there and it was really busy already. We then started driving, and started trying the goodies we got. But goodies they were not. The buns that we ordered turned out to be meat buns, and I had a few bites of it before realizing. It felt really wrong and I couldn't eat any more, and asked Sam to pull over into a rest stop/gas station area where I had to vomit. I just felt the shame and guilt of eating meat overwhelm me, and couldn't stop crying.</p>

<h3>Las Vegas Farmer's Market</h3>
<p>Bruce Trent Park had a farmer's market! We visited Desert Moon Mushrooms stall with chestnut mushrooms, and also a vegan food stand with noddles <a href="https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y-wqrsSoSqqrDYQUiugeSw/o.jpg">www.o-g-lolas.com</a> maybe?

<h3>The Strip</h3>
<p>Earlier in the day we saw the Bliss Dance Statue (and the very dumb Salt Bae restaurant). Walked through many casinos. We went on The Big Apple Coaster in the New York New York Hotel & Casino, which had one loop and one big turn. It was not super crowded but there was somewhat of a line, and it was more intense than the Santa Monica Pier one (if that can even be called a coaster).</p>

<h3>Boulder City AirBnB</h3>
<p>The two hosts of the tiny home AirBnB that we stayed at are a couple that used to travel all around. It's a super charming home but to get to the loft bed, we had to use a scary ladder that didn't feel very stable. The loft bed had a tapestry that covered the slanted ceiling, and the tapestry had elephants with funny-looking eyes and flowers on it.</p>
<p>The previous renters left 3 recipes in a recipe book in the AirBnB, and I thought I'd contribute one too (that wasn't cake) for variety, and to continue the vegan theme.</p>

<h3>Las Vegas</h3>
<p>Setting off, we arrived bright and early at 7 at Madhouse Coffee. The bathroom was lit by a purple UV light, and there were stickers and writing everywhere. It reminded me of 924 Gilman Street, where we saw <a href="https://businessschool.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Business School</a> perform for the first time.</p>

We learned that "Death Valley" is a sensationalized name, and the original name for the area is "Timbisha," which was named after the red pigment found in the land.</p>

<h3>UFO convenience store in Baker, CA</h3>
<p>On the way to Baldwin Park when we filled gas, there was a person who drove by trying to sell jewelry from their truck (likely a scam) at the station. When Sam tried to go into a casino called Whiskey Pete's in Nevada to use the restroom, someone tried to sell him earpods (definitely a scam).</p>
<p>We visited <a href="www.alienfreshjerky.com" target="_blank">Alien Fresh Jerky</a>, which I saw from <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alien-fresh-jerky" target="_blank">Atlas Obscura</a>. It was very gimmicky and we didn't actually buy anything there because they had a bunch of meat and I couldn't find a good sticker. We saw some really neat installations though, and we walked around a bit. There was a nearby town called Zzyzx.</p>

<h3>Downtown Montebello</h3>
<p>We met up for dinner with one of my best friends from uni! I just saw her three months ago, but this time she could meet Sam too. We went to <a href="https://www.blvdmrkt.com" target="_blank">BLVD MRKT</a> that had multiple food options, and exchanged holiday presents. Sam and I got pupusas from <a href="https://vchostruck.com" target="_blank">VCHOS</a>, and my friend got pizza from <a href="https://www.lacrostala.com" target="_blank">La Crosta</a>. After sitting around and catching up, we went to get smoothies from <a href="https://neverajuicebar.com/montebello" target="_blank">Nevera Juice Bar</a>. While walking back we came across an empty shop that had gaudy looking decor (with a suit of armor for some reason too), and it looked old and dusty and forgotten, and we joked around and took pictures. It was strange that two of my favorite people from two different parts of my life were in the same place at the same time.</p>

<h3>Coffee</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Lido Marina Village</h3>
<p>We had dunch at Malibu Lido Farm, and it was also reccomended by Sam because his family went and it was good. It was a lot bougier than expected and the portions weren't even enough to get full from even though it felt extremely costly. The waterfront view was nice but there were a bunch of people who felt like they were looking at us with nonfriendly expressions on their faces.</p>

<p>Lots of interesting art, especially the <a href="https://ocma.art/ray-charles/ink-box-1986" target="_blank">Ink Box</a> by Charles Ray. The <a href="https://ocma.art/bul-lee/supernova-2000" target="_blank">Supernova</a> by Lee Bul was also super impressive. Another interesting series of pieces was from this one lady that made driftwood mixed-found-materias statues of deceased family members.</p>

<h3>Garduno's Taco King</h3>
<p>Had some very excellent vegan jackfruit tacos, even though it was late-o'clock.</p>
